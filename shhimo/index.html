	<h5 class='center'>Christ is in our midst! He is and ever shall be!</h5>
	<h5 class='center'>What does the word “Sh’himo” mean?</h5>
	<p>“Sh’himo” is the Syriac word for “common” or “ordinary.” It
	simply refers to the prayers that are done on ordinary days (outside of
	the three day fast of Nineveh and the Great Fast) when there is not an
	important feast of the Church being celebrated. The Sh’himo prayers do
	not include Sunday, as every Sunday is a festal day on which we celebrate the Resurrection (<i>Qyomtho</i>) of our Lord.</p>

	<h5 class='center'>What are the seven times of prayer?</h5>
	<p>The Church has developed seven liturgical hours of prayer. 
	It was King David, the Psalmist, who wrote, “Seven times a day I praise You, because of Your righteous judgments” (<i>Psalm 119:164</i>). The hours of prayer are as follows:</p>

	<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

		<td>3:00 PM</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
	</table>
	<h5 class='center'>When does the liturgical day begin?</h5>
	<p>In the Creation account we read: “that God called the light Day, and
	the darkness He called Night. So the evening and the morning were the
	first day” (Gen. 1:5). In the Syriac tradition, the day
	begins with the evening (generally after 6PM). For example,
	Monday Vespers would be observed on Sunday evening, Tuesday Vespers on
	Monday evening, etc.</p>
	<h5 class='center'>What are the themes that correlate to each hour of prayer?</h5>
	<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

		<td>'General themes'</td>

		</tr>
	</tbody>
	</table>
	<p>The third, sixth and ninth hours are associated with our Fall and
	Salvation. They are decisive moments in the history of salvation. This
	is particular because at the third hour our Lord received judgment from
	Pilate; at the sixth hour Christ was crucified and the ninth hour our
	Lord gave His spirit up into the hands of His Father.</p>

	<h5 class='center'>What are the themes that correlate to each day?</h5>
	<p>The Sh’himo Prayers have general themes that correspond to each day of the week:</p>
	<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
		<th>Day</th>
		<th>Theme</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>Sunday</td>
		<td>Resurrection of Christ</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>Monday</td>
		<td>Repentance</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>Tuesday</td>
		<td>Repentance</td>

		<tr>
		<td>Wednesday</td>
		<td>The Theotokos*<br>(*Greek word which means “God birth-giver”)<br>
		</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>

		<td>Holy Apostles and Saints</td>

		<tr>
		<td>Friday</td>
		<td>Holy Cross, Martyrs, Confessors</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>Saturday</td>
		<td>Departed Clergy and Laity</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
	</table>
	<p>On Friday, we remember the Cross as it was on Friday when our Lord was
	crucified. We also remember the Martyrs and Confessors who
	suffered for the love of Christ.</p>
	<p>Saturday, we remember all the faithful departed. It was on Holy
	Saturday when our Lord entered into Hades and preached the Gospel to
	the departed ones.</p>
	<p>Every Sunday, we celebrate the feast of feasts, the Resurrection of our Lord.</p>

	<h5 class='center'>How should we pray the Sh’himo?</h5>
	<ol><li><b>Pray while standing</b> - One of
	the main prayers we say throughout the Sh’himo is the “Qauma.” It
	is familiar to many of us as it begins with “Holy art Thou O God, Holy
	art Thou Immortal…” The word “Qauma” means “standing.” We
	stand in prayer as we are acknowledging the presence of God. We
	stand as a sign of reverence and respect.</li>

	<li><b>Kneeling during prayer</b> - We
	kneel to show our submission to our Lord. For example, when we
	say “Crucified for us, have mercy on us”, we should kneel and make the
	sign of the Cross. In this book, when we see “†”, we are reminded
	to kneel and make the sign of the Cross. We do not kneel for the
	liturgical prayers on Sunday in commemoration of the joyous
	Resurrection of our Lord.</li>

	<li><b>Facing east during prayer</b> -
	When we pray we should face east as it is a sign of awaiting and
	anticipating our Lord’s glorious second coming. Christ says, “For
	as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also
	will the coming of the Son of Man be” (Matt. 24:27). </li>
	</ol>

	<p>Standing, kneeling, making the sign of the cross, and facing east are
	all ways that we worship and pray with our bodies. We believe
	that the Holy Spirit has sanctified our bodies as the Temple of God (1
	Cor. 6:19). Christ, in His Resurrection, gave us hope in the
	resurrection of both the body and the soul. Therefore, our
	bodies, along with our hearts and minds, are called to participate in prayer.</p>

	<p>Our life as a Christian should be in communion with God, Who is
	love. In our communion with God, we are also brought into
	communion with those who loved God during their lifetime: the Saints
	and the faithful departed as well as our faithful brethren on this earth. Prayer for the Orthodox is personal, yet communal.</p>

	<p>The canonical prayer has a place in God’s plan for our salvation. The
	liturgical hours gives us a foretaste of the life in the kingdom, where
	we will glorify God unceasingly. The Church has developed the Sh’himo
	prayers as a tool to help us organize our life around prayer. While this is only an abridged version of the Sh’himo evening prayers,
	may this help to strengthen the prayer life in our homes and our communion with God.</p>
	<h5 class='center'>Glory to Jesus Christ! Glory forever!</h5>

<section class="container">
	<h5 class='center'>Prefatory Prayer</h5>
	<i>We pray standing upright while facing East as we collect our thoughts on God.</i>
	<p>† In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, one true God;</p>
	<p>Glory be to Him, and may His grace and mercy be upon us forever. Amen.</p>
	<p>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, by whose glory, the heaven and earth are filled. Hosanna in the Highest!</p>
	<p>Blessed is He, who has come, / and is to come, in the name of the Lord; Glory be to Him in the Highest!</p>

	<h5 class='center'>Qaumo</h5>
	<i>Each Hour of Prayer BEGINS and CONCLUDES with a Qaumo, except when the Praise of the Cherubim is prayed at the conclusion of Compline.</i>
	<p>We make the sign of the Cross and kneel as we pray “Crucified for us…”</p></i>

	<p>Holy art Thou, O God!<br>
	Holy art Thou, Almighty!<br>
	Holy art Thou, Immortal!<br>
	+ Crucified for us, Have mercy upon us!
	(<i>Three times</i>)</p>

	<p>Lord, have mercy upon us!<br>
	Lord, be kind and have mercy!<br>
	Lord, accept our service and our prayers!
	Have mercy upon us!</p>

	<p>Glory be to Thee, O God!<br>
	Glory be to Thee, O Creator!<br>
	Glory be to Thee, O Christ the King<br>
	Who has compassion on His sinful servants. Barekmor.</p>

	<p>Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread and forgive us our debts and sins as we also have forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. + For Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.</p>

	(<i>This prayer is not originally part of the Qaumo, but may be recited.</i>)

	<p>Peace be with You, Mary/(Hail Mary), full of grace, / our Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women,/ and blessed is the fruit of your womb, our Lord Jesus, Christ./ O, Virgin Saint Mary, Mother of God,/ pray for us sinners, / now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.</p>

	<h5 class='center'>Nicene Creed</h5>
	<p>We believe in one true God, the Father Almighty / Maker of heaven and earth / and of all things visible and invisible.</p>
	<p>And in One Lord Jesus Christ / the Only-Begotten Son of God / begotten of the Father
	before all worlds / Light of Light / True God of True God / begotten,/ not made /
	being of one essence with the Father / and by Whom all things were made;</p>
	<p>+ Who for us men and for our salvation / came down from heaven</p>
	<p>+ And was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and of the Holy Virgin Mary / Mother of
	God/and became man,</p>
	<p>+ And was crucified for us / in the days of Pontius Pilate / and suffered, and died, and
	was buried,</p>
	<p>+ And on the third day He rose again/ according to His Will / and ascended into
	heaven / and sits at the right hand of His Father / and shall come again in His great
	glory / to judge both the living and the dead / whose kingdom shall have no end.</p>
	<p>And in the one Living Holy Spirit / the life-giving Lord of all / Who proceeds from the
	Father / and Who together with the Father and the Son is worshipped and glorified/
	who spoke through the prophets and the apostles.</p>
	<p>And in the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. And we confess one baptism for
	the remission of sins / and we look for the resurrection of the dead /and the new life in the world to come.</p>
	<p>Amen. Barekmor. Stoumen kalos, Kurielaison.</p>
