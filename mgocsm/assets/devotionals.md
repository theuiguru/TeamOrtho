## The Keys to a Successful Life
### Published on Jan 30 2013 By Rev. Fr. Aju Philip Mathews, Former Assistant Vicar of St. Mary’s Orthodox Cathedral of Philadelphia
Let me begin by acknowledging that the title of my devotional is a bit pretentious given that my life has been far from successful ineverything I have set out to do. Also, I am far from an expert on experiencing success as the world has defined it. But it is within that last statement that I find the reason to even comment on such a topic. See, the world has always defined success for us. Success is having wealth, never being hungry or needy. Success is having a good name in the communities we live. Success is having health, being fit and beautiful in the eyes of society that is constantly judging us. And with the new year upon us and many unattainable resolutions about our successes, goals, and life changes for the year hanging above our heads, I felt like we could use a look at this with some fresh eyes.
Recently, at a housewarming, I heard a brother priest preach to the family about what true love and happiness was. He taught that the Gospel story of Zacchaeus gave us insight into the moment that a person can truly achieve happiness and true success. Until Zacchaeus the tax-collector had heard about Jesus, his life was about achieving success and happiness. He was the typical tax-collector of his time: greedy, opportunistic, parasitic, and concerned about only one person: himself. Yet, when he had heard about a rabbi named Jesus, who promised eternal life and true peace, Zacchaeus jumped at the opportunity to go to see Him. Making an extreme effort to see, the short Zacchaeus climbs the sycamore tree. There, Jesus sees him, invites Himself to his house. Zacchaeus joyfully receives the Lord, despite the complaints of the people. The presence of the Lord in Zacchaeus’s house changes Zacchaeus. He is still a man who is looking for success and happiness, but those things are no longer tied to this world. Zacchaeus knows true salvation and joy in his life, when he not only gives back what he wrongly took, but when he gives it back four fold. And, when he gives half of what he has to the poor. When he gives back to the needy and gives of himself enough to hurt his financial and social status, Jesus says to him, “Today salvation has come to this house…” Success!
And isn’t that really what the true meaning of love is? To give until it hurts. To sacrifice so that we might know what it is to want, the way a babe wants nothing more than the touch and care of his/her mother. No amount of toys or fancy clothes or status symbols makes a child happier than to know the love and care of its’ mother. That should be our relationship to our Lord: To want Him with our whole heart, soul and mind
Our success is directly tied to our dependence on Christ and our independence from our mortal ties. This is not to say that the world is evil. All that the Lord creates is good, as we read in Genesis. However, we know that when our ties to earthly things supersede our ties to heavenly things, we never truly know happiness. What we build up in homes, cars, and material wealth can be easily torn down by strong winds and rain, as people in New Orleans, the Jersey Shore and New York can attest to. What we build up in our status and name can just as easily be destroyed by news of our one wrong-doing or weakness. Like our Lord says, until we are willing to give up house and home, family and friends, to take up His Cross, we will not be able to enter the Kingdom. That Kingdom is true success, unending joy, and eternal happiness. We have to let our hands free of the things that perish in order to hold onto the things that never perish.
May the Spirit of Wisdom and Truth fill our hearts with strength and courage to love until it hurts.

## “Do not fear, little flock”

Luke 12:32-48 (Gospel Reading for February 3rd, 2013)
A visit to an Emergency Room is scary particularly when the doctor takes out a sharp and pointy needle.  We suppress that impulse to run and rather listen to the explanation why the medicine will make us healthy once again.  We do so with the understanding we are sick, and trust the doctor’s wisdom to bring us back to health.
The Church often uses comparisons to medicine to teach doctrine, particularly when it comes to Salvation and the strong connection to spiritual healing.  To put simply, for Orthodox Christians being “saved” means being healed.  Being “saved” is to be Holy (1 Peter 2:9).  In our Faith, Salvation is a person, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, as well as a process where we constantly make choices to become like Him.
This understanding is important when reflecting on this passage from the Gospel of St. Luke.  At first glance, we may see a contradiction – a God who is a loving Father, good and kind, One whom we need not fear … but later a slave-master, punishing and beating those who ignore His commands.  We often skip these troublesome verses as they confuse us … but by doing so we unknowingly miss important lessons (yes, life-saving!) about the Holy Trinity.  The purpose of Holy Scripture is to help us know God (John 20:30-31).
The good news? God is love.  As we see, for example, in the Parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32) the father gives everything to his children and yet allows his prodigal son the freedom to waste away the gifts that have been given.  However after the son “came to himself“ (Luke 15: 17) and the son remembered who he was and where he had come from, he repented and began his journey home … only to return to the embrace of a joyous and happy father who ran out to meet and kiss him even before the son could utter a word!
Love exists only when there is freedom.  Our Almighty and all-powerful God loves us so much that He blesses us with free-will and the ability to make our own choices.  In the parable, the prodigal son could have chosen to stay in the far-away land and the story would have had a much different ending … but even this narration of the tale would not have changed that the Father is loving, generous and humble.
Sin also exists, and as the Church teaches Sin should be thought of as sickness.  Choosing to Sin has devastating effects on us, and the most dangerous type is subtle ... where we think and justify actions not of God as being “OK”, or when we look and see everybody doing something and fool ourselves into thinking it must not be a big deal.  But illness not treated gets worse and destroys the body even if the patient initially feels good.  Over time, the body grows weaker and may get sick with something else … reaching a point where even the strongest medicine may not be enough.  At this stage, rather than enjoy the benefits and rewards of good health the patient feels the pain and agony of sickness.
Christ says, “Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes” (v 43)… but doing what? Being a Christian!  Our Faith must be active, a constant effort to be like Christ.  The judgment will be whether we are followers of Christ in all our thoughts, words and deeds (1 Corinthians 9:27).  We approach this with fear and trembling, as the more we know God the more we realize how utterly frail and weak are we, and how easy we fall. Just like a person can become sick again, we too can succumb to temptations and temporary riches of this world … but it’s never too late to repent.  It’s never too late to start working to be spiritual healthy!  Especially when we know the love our God has for His children.
This is why our Lord reminds us, “do not fear, little flock” (v 32).  Do not be afraid!  God is ready to shower His love and blessings, but it is and always remains our choice.  Let us get ready.  Let us follow wisdom.  Let us remember our Faith.
Christ is our Doctor and the Church is our hospital – both essential to curing the unhealthy and destructive effects of Sin on our body.  In the Parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:29-37), Christ (the Samaritan) is the healer, the Great Physician, who rescues us, man who is wounded.  Man is given bandages, oil and wine - images of the Sacraments (Baptism, Chrismation and Holy Qurbana or Eucharist) and taken to heal to the inn, an image of the Church.  The goal of everything we do - every ministry, every prayer , every sermon or every devotional - is to bring us closer to the Church, which is the Body of Christ.  It’s all about Christ.
But as Fr. Seraphim Rose warns - “we constantly rebel, try to make life easier, try to be half-Christian, try to make the best of both worlds”. And as Fr. Anthony Messeh reminds, “Christ loved us so much He died on the Cross … this is true.  But he also loved us so much He spent 33 years without sinning. Why can’t we make it through even one day?”
“But if one chooses to continue and to sin perpetually in pleasures, and values indulgence here above eternal life, and turns away from the Savior, who gives forgiveness; let him no more blame either God, or riches, or his having fallen, but his own soul, which voluntarily perishes. But to him who directs his eye to salvation and desires it, and asks with boldness and vehemence for its bestowal, the good Father who is in heaven will give the true purification and the changeless life. To whom, by His Son Jesus Christ, the Lord of the living and dead, and by the Holy Spirit, be glory, honor, power, eternal majesty, both now and ever, from generation to generation, and from eternity to eternity. Amen.”  (St Clement of Alexandria)
#### Questions for Meditation
1)“A handful of sand, thrown into the sea, is what sinning is, when compared to God’s Providence and mercy. Just like an abundant source of water is not impeded by a handful of dust, so does the Creator’s mercy not defeated by the sins of His creations.” – have you ever felt you did something so bad, so terrible, that you were embarrassed to come to Church?  What is the message that St. Isaac the Syrian is giving for anyone who feels this way?
2) Meditate on Luke 12: 34 i.e., “Wherever your treasure is, there your heart and thoughts will also be”.   Look back on how your time, money, and energy was spent this past week - what do you think about most? What got you most excited? Where did you spend your money compared to the offering you gave at Church? Reflect on how you could change the way you use your resources in order to reflect Kingdom values more accurately.
#### A Prayer
Let my heart be strengthened and fortified by the grace of Baptism which I have received, so that I am seen as light in the world.  Let me be strengthened by the power of the Holy Spirit from above.  Let me hate and turn away my face from the old man who is corrupted by the pleasure and desire to sin.  Let me be the bearer of the Word of Life to unbelievers.  Let me continue to hasten to new life, which is promised to the faithful, and may I be worthy to reign with Christ by the abundance of His great mercy.
*The above is based on the prayer of the priest after the anointing of Holy Chrism during the Liturgical Sacrament of Baptism.   It is a reminder to all who are participating in the Baptism that the Sacrament is only a beginning of our walk with Christ and that our Salvation is both a person, our Lord Jesus Christ, and a process (theosis) where we grow strengthened through Sacramental Life to become like Christ.

## Transform Me, O, Lord
### Published on Feb 13, 2013 by Ansa Thomas, St. Mary’s Orthodox Church, Staten Island, NY
“Whatever He says to you, do it.” - St. John 2:1-11
The Great Lent is upon us. The Great Lent is a spiritual journey, which helps us to get closer to God.  This past Sunday, we recall one of the first miracles, which took place at the wedding feast in Cana.
“And when they ran out of wine, the mother of Jesus said to Him, “They have no wine.”Jesus said to her, “Woman, what does your concern have to do with Me? My hour has not yet come.”His mother said to the servants, “Whatever He says to you, do it.” St. John 2: 3-6
There are several themes that are in these verses.  But, let us focus on the Lord Jesus’ reply to His mother, “Woman, what does your concern have to do with Me? My hour has not yet come.” (St. John 2: 4)  The Lord Jesus asked His mother what I am supposed to do if the wine is finished.  It is almost like asking what do you want from me.  For the most part, our parents know what we are capable of and sometimes we tend to surprise them.  St. Mary knew that her son was capable to extend a helping hand at the wedding feast.  And how many of you have been in this situation before, when your parent or elder asked you to do something and you hesitated or even ignored him/her?
In the next line of the verse, the Lord Jesus also told His mother that it is not time for me to show everyone who I am publicly.  It is not time for everyone to know that He is the Son of God.    St. Mary did not reply to her son.  She replied to the servants, “Whatever He says to you, do it.” And Jesus said to them, “Fill the water pots with water.  And they filled them up to the brim” (verse 7).  The water changed to wine and it was the best wine.   Even though the Lord Jesus gave a quick response to His mother when she requested His assistance, He still helped out.  If the wine ran out, the wedding guests would have grumbled and been upset with the newlyweds.   The Lord Jesus presented this miracle not only to display His compassion but also to show the glory of God.
We learn so much from this miracle, which is appropriate as we begin the spiritual journey of the Great Lent.  We learn obedience; the Lord Jesus listens to His mother and shows compassion and love.  St. Mary tells the servants to do the will of her son.  What if you were one of those servants at the wedding feast?  St. Mary intercedes for us.  And she asks us (the servants), Whatever He says to you, do it.”  During this Lenten season, ask yourself, can I do the will of God?
Reflecting on your life right now, are you straying from church, from your parents/family, from God?  Take those obstacles or forces out of your life that is keeping you away from God.  Ask God to wash away your sins, repent.  Make the change in your life that will bring you back to Him.  Ask the Lord to transform you like He transformed the water into wine.
During this Great and Holy Lent, here are some guidelines to help you on your journey:
Communicate with God by: reading the Holy Bible daily (look at the Great Lent Scripture guides);
Praying (prostrating/kneeling) in the morning, afternoon, evening, midnight prayers;
Mediate on Scripture or on the Jesus Prayer: ‘O, Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, Have mercy upon me  a sinner’;
Abstain/fast not only from meat, fish, dairy, but also from things/people that hinder your relationship with God (friends, parties, TV, movies, music, habits, behaviors, etc…);
Be in Communion with God: by receiving Holy Qurbana with a penitent heart;
Help others out: give to those that need help, by donating clothes or food or giving a helping hand.

You are not alone in this journey, if you go off course; seek help from the clergy or from your church.  This journey is not easy, but if you stay the course, you will grow closer to God.  May the Lord guide you and give you strength as you embark on this Lenten voyage.
#### Questions for Meditation
1) Reflection: Are you going down the wrong road?  If yes, how can you turn back to God?  Are you going down the right road?  If yes, how can you stay on it?
2) Mediate on the following verse: “Teach me to do your will, for you are my God; may your good Spirit lead me on level ground.” Psalm 143:10

## Sunday of the Leper
### Published on Feb 20, 2013 by Joseph Mathews (Jobi), Houston (St. Gregorios Orthodox Church), 281-235-2571, mathews.joseph@gmail.com
St. Luke 5:12-16, 4:40-41
Imagine being affected by a disease that causes severe disfiguring skin sores and nerve damage. The bacteria would attack and deaden the nerves and cause loss of feeling in the arms and legs. The nerves stopped sending warning signals to the affected hands and feet, so individuals lost the ability to detect pain from injury, burns and fracture causing them to lose their limbs. This disease is leprosy.
While a student at Christian Medical College, Vellore (India), I assisted in treating a leprous patient where we found a nail that was embedded in his foot, possibly for several weeks and covered by callous (dead skin). This had gotten infected causing the doctors to amputate the foot to save his life. He could have prevented this by proper and regular examination of himself and seeking medical help before it was too late. It reminds me to this day of a more dangerous condition-sin- that creeps into our lives and causes spiritual death because of our lack of discipline and self-examination.
In the Old Testament we find that leprosy was a primary type or symbol of sin and death. Sin does to the soul what leprosy does to the body. As leprosy deadens the nerves, so similarly sin defiles the conscience. Leprosy was daily dying. Every day a part of you died, today a finger, tomorrow a toe until you became a mass of ulcerated malodorous growth. Sin is separation from God, from the only true life in Him and with Him. Separation from God is death—because life can only exist where God is present. When we live in sin we are living in state of spiritual death.
Just as lepers were forced to live outside the village or in a separated area, sin leads an individual to a fallen world life outside of the Church.  The priest declared that a leprous person was unclean; similarly all sin is declared unclean by the Lord.
St Luke 5: 12-14
And it happened when He was in a certain city, that behold, a man who was full of leprosy saw Jesus; and he fell on his face and implored Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.” Then He put out His hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing; be cleansed.”Immediately the leprosy left him.  And He charged him to tell no one, “But go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, as a testimony to them, just as Moses commanded.”
In this passage we see that Christ is the one who cleanses all mankind-if man is willing-from the leprosy of sin and all its effects.  Just as the other miracles mentioned in the great Lent, it was the humility and complete faith of the leper that heals him. He did not doubt and knew that Jesus was capable of healing him. “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean” was his plea. Jesus was moved by his faith and said “but “I am willing; be cleansed.”
We should review this passage in light of two other individuals who were healed of leprosy in the Old Testament.
Moses beseeched God to remove his sister (Miriam’s) leprosy. Even then the leprosy left her only in seven days. (Numbers 12:10-16)
Just as Naaman the Syrian who was diseased with leprosy was cleansed by dipping in the river Jordan, so also we receive regeneration from sin by Baptism (St Gregory of Nyssa).  Elisha we see did not touch him but only asked Naaman to dip in the river Jordan for cleansing. (2 Kings 5:1-19).
The immediate removal of leprosy was a testimony to the priests that Christ is above all and the healing was with His own divine authority.  St Cyril of Alexandria writes that this is why in the end of Christ gives this command “Show yourself to the priest” to convince the priests by a tangible miracle that He is incomparably superior to Moses. Touching the unclean (leprous) was forbidden yet Jesus touched the leper possibly because of His compassion. Jesus also shows that He was above the Law as the leprosy did not affect Him but His touch cleansed the leprosy (sin).
“All things are possible to one who believes”, said Jesus (Mark 9:23). The only limit to the power of God in our lives is the limit of our own faith.  David is presumed to be writing about healing him from the leprosy of sin when he writes “Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow” (Psalm 51:5). He later goes on to add that God cannot and will not despise a broken and contrite heart.
This Lent let us humble ourselves before the Lord, admit our lack of complete and absolute faith and pray to the Lord for forgiveness of our sins. Let us continually examine ourselves lest sin deaden our conscience and cause us to live in a fallen world. Let us implore of the Lord before it is too late. He is capable and willing to say “I am willing; be cleansed.”
#### Questions for Meditation
1) Why is constant self-examination so important in this world we live in?
2) Why do you believe that Jesus “touched” the leper when his words were enough for healing? How has He “touched” you recently?

## The Healing of the Paralytic
### Published on Feb 27 2013 by Rekha Mathew, St. Gregorios Orthodox Church, San Francisco, CA, ever_joyful@hotmail.com
Gospel of St. Mark 2:1-12
As the Church continues her journey into the heart of the Great Fast, she calls her children to reflect upon the healing ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ. This Sunday, the Church recalls the healing of the paralytic. There is no mention of how long this poor man was in his condition. But we can assume by the fact that he was bedridden and not able to at least drag himself by some means, that his paralysis was severe, most likely from the neck down.
Imagine for a moment his state of being. Imagine having an itch on your face and not being able to scratch it.  Imagine having to watch your loved ones toil over you as they carry your limp limbs, as they clean and feed you while you lie more helpless than an infant. Imagine how long the days, the hours and the minutes seem as you lie staring in whatever direction you had last been placed. Imagine being able to see life going on all around you, while being completely unable to experiencing.  Your body is attached, yet completely cut off from you. It is incapable of receiving or transmitting information to your brain and so it is as good as dead to you. For your body, though it should be a tool for you to live and act in this world, is now your bondage.
Now imagine this state of being going beyond a limp and unresponsive body, to the very depths of the heart and soul. A soul that is cut off from communion with God is cut off from Life itself. No longer useful for the purpose for which it has been created, it is in a state of inescapable bondage to sin and death. And this is what our Lord saw when he looked upon the paralytic: a  soul withering away, incapable of relating with God, as much as He saw a body incapable of relating to the brain. So He pronounces the words “Son, your sins are forgiven.” By this Word, the paralytic is reclaimed from death, healed from sin, freed to experience unhindered Communion with God Almighty and empowered to walk and grow in His Image. 
And this same Word, who was and  is and always will be, spans time and space, from Capernaum and two thousand years ago to the here and now, from the paralytic to me and to you: “Child, your sins are forgiven.” And because we do not often live as those who are forgiven, as those who are healed, the Church brings us to this place each year, to hear the Word anew. May the Word of forgiveness, the Word of healing, the Word of Life, release each one of us from whatever binds us during this Great Fast, that we may be able to rise with Him and walk with Him as we look to anticipate the Paschal Feast and His Kingdom to come.
#### Questions for Meditation
1. Where can you see an onset of “paralysis” in your relationship with God?  Pray right now and ask Him to heal those areas.  Be steadfast in all spiritual disciplines that build you up in His image.  Recommit yourself to abstain from any bad habits/ relationships etc. that may be causing a block in your communion with God.
2. Do you see someone in your life that needs to be carried to Christ in prayer because their paralysis is so grave?  Pray for them now and throughout this Lenten period.  Faithful intercession precedes intervention (i.e. pray before you break down a roof!)
3. Do you surround yourself with people who bring you to Christ when you are unable to choose Him for yourself?  Consider your friendships - invest in those that inspire you to grow in Christ.
4. Are you thankful for your body?  Do you treat it as the Temple of God? Like the paralytic whose inward healing was manifested outwardly, let your healthy habits this Lent extend beyond prayer and Bible reading and Church, etc. to exercise and good nutrition.

## The Silence before the Feast
### Published on Mar 06 2013 by Christopher Awad, Brooklyn/Queens/Long Island, NY, 646-348-4787, Christopher11004@gmail.com
Matthew 15:21-31
“Wise men are not always silent, but they know when to be.”—Unknown
It used to baffle me to see Christ silent in this passage. The Lord of Lords, the King of Kings— He who “spoke the world into being” (Ps 33:9) — was hushed by the cries of a woman who, running after Him, beseeched him in a manner not unlike our own daily supplications. I imagine my own life; how I’ve spent time with God in prayer, asking Him—begging Him—and sometimes feeling very like this woman in the passage: left to wonder whether or not Christ would answer. It wasn’t until recently that I realized what God was doing with this woman, and what He sometimes does in my, or your, own life. Do you sometimes feel like Christ is silent? Do you ask God “Why haven’t I heard You yet?” or “Why haven’t You spoken?” Then you’ll appreciate this passage from Matthew because, as we will see, God’s silence serves a greater purpose in this woman’s life, and, in yours and mine.
Christ knew her faith. There’s no doubt about that. But what’s so beautiful about this encounter is that God’s silence is used for our instruction. When the conversation begins it is not clear to us what type of faith she has in Him:
She screams out to Him “Lord!” –and He is silent. Persistent she continues, and the gospel records that she then “WorshipsHim” (v25). Matthew’s description of worship here is huge! Worship would have signified an activity of your whole body—she might have done something like come before them all in the street and laid her whole body down beseeching Him. “Lord, help me” (v25).
Soon after, Christ continues to push her. It is this that we know all too well. Christ is entreating this woman, and all of us, toshow Him our faith, to worship Him with everything we have—to throw ourselves down before Him, shameless, and say “Son of David, have mercy on me a sinner because alone, by your mercy, I am saved.” Christ says to her, “It is not good to take the food of the Children and give it to the dogs.” And she understanding—knowing that Christ is God and that He came through the promise made to the Israelites, and that his mercy can not be earned—shouts out, in faith “Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.” She cries to Him and says, “I know God! I know! I am before you begging for favor that can not be earned.” Moved by her faith, Christ blesses her and heals her daughter. This perseverance in tribulation and sole reliance on God is what Christ wants to characterize our faith, and this is the type of faith that Christ calls us to.  Faith that is whole-hearted. Faith that is passionate. Faith that is helpless. Faith that moves mountains and moves God. This is what God desires of us during our Lenten journey; cultivation of a faith that knows nothing but Him. The woman sought no one but Him and in so doing, received the fullness of God in His promise.
But what’s the table for us? We’ve seen now that Christ’s silence is instructive— His momentary choice to “say not a word” is admonishment to our faith. That when we have storms and silence, troubles and tribulations, pains and groans that we share with our Savior, that His momentary silence is only momentary and solely for our edification. His silence draws our increased prayer—our increased manifestation of faith—to Him. He will never remain silent indefinitely, and certainly always hears us. Sometimes it is I who need to show my faith in Him, so that when He does answer I will truly rejoice, and one-day delight at “the feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom from heaven” (Matt 8:11). This is the table—the heavenly feast that Christ invites those who believe in Him to. Once reserved only for those “chosen,” the feast is now given to all the faithful, prepared for us from the time of old. A heavenly and beautiful table, the feast is set before the faithful as a reminder of the sweetness of Christ’s promise and reward in times of tribulations. Saints and martyrs, faithful and beloved of Christ alike will one day sit around the table— strengthened by the tribulations they’ve endured—and meet Him face to face.
In this time of Lent, let us be encouraged through moments of silence and continue to be reminded of God’s promises to us.
#### Questions for Reflection:
1. Has God been silent recently? How can I personally be encouraged by this story as I continue to walk with Christ?
2. Have I given it my all? Is God calling me to a greater faith? How could I change my approach of God in prayer?

## Sunday of Healing the Crippled Woman
### Published on Mar 13 2013 by John Mathew, Dallas, TX, (214) 676-9932, JohnMathew45@gmail.com
St. Luke 13:10-17
Often times I find myself saying, “That can wait till tomorrow”. Procrastination – without a doubt, the number one thing I’d like to change about myself. In fact, it’s been on my “New Year’s Resolution” list 6 years in a row and without a doubt it’ll be on next year’s list too. I’ve been told that God despises sloth and procrastination, and as a self-proclaimed “Master Procrastinator,” I can see why. However, you might be asking yourself, “What does procrastination have to do with the healing of the crippled woman?” Let’s find out:
“Now He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bent over and could in no way raise herself up. But when Jesus saw her, He called her to Him and said to her, “Woman, you are loosed from your infirmity. And He laid His hand on her, and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.” But the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath; and he said to the crowd, “There are six days on which men ought to work; therefore come and be healed on them, and not on the Sabbath day.” (St. Luke 10:10-14).
When I initially read this passage, I tried to mentally put myself in Christ’s shoes (or sandals) and think “What would I have done in His place?” We all know that Jesus, aside from being the Son of God, was very well-versed with the Law. In fact, as a young adolescent, we see Jesus teaching the elders of the temple. So, clearly He knew that healing the woman on the Sabbath would, at the very least, cause a disturbance among the leaders of the synagogue. This is where I sought to apply the Laws of Procrastination: this woman was bent for 18 years, and healing her now would only cause needless commotion. Why not wait one more day? I mean, if she could wait 18 years to be healed, surely one more day wouldn’t be a huge sacrifice? No drama today and the woman would eventually be healed; clearly, this was the best solution for all parties involved. You have to wonder if Jesus came to the same conclusion as well. Maybe He did but then rejected it because it’s pretty stupid. It’s stupid because there is never a wrong time to do what is right. Yes, it would have been easier for Jesus to say, “Woman, I know you have suffered for 18 years, but in order to please the hypocrites around us, come meet me tomorrow.” How many times in our lives have we put off doing what we know is right? How many times have we said in our hearts, “These problems will still be here tomorrow and I’m only one person.”
As I read this passage again, I couldn’t help but put myself in the bent woman’s shoes as well. What kind of hardships did she endure? Was she in pain? What kind of ridicule and shame did she suffer? Let’s the honest, people can be cruel. I think it’s safe to assume that she didn’t like being bent or stuck in that position, especially for 18 years. I wonder how intense her joy was when she was FINALLY able to stand up straight! I believe each of us in our own ways are somewhat “bent”. Or maybe this just applies to those who aren’t very confident in themselves. I’m sure if we take a few minutes we could come up with a list of “flaws” we don’t like about ourselves. I’m not tall enough, smart enough, attractive enough, etc, etc. Hopefully, none of these self-conscious feelings will prevent us from doing the things we enjoy, but unfortunately, we hear stories of bullying all too often.
Growing up, I was what some people might call a nerd. I even had thick glasses – how I hated those glasses!
It wasn’t always easy growing up as an Indian in a predominately affluent, white neighbourhood, especially as The Simpsons became popular. I can’t recall how many times I’ve been asked if I know how to make a “Squishee” or if Apu was my uncle. Yes, the cartoon character is my uncle...well, I can’t say I grew up with the brightest peers but some of them made my life pretty hard. I remember praying and asking God why He made me this way and to let me be like the other kids. I imagine the crippled woman felt the same way. I’m sure she asked herself why this happening to her was or what she did to deserve this life. Well, maybe dealing with my “nerdism” wasn’t as hard as being bent over for 18 years, but at the time it was difficult. I remember thinking one day, why do I care what these idiots think? So, after a “Dang, can you see Pluto with those glasses?!” I responded with, “Only if I squint really hard.” It wasn’t long after that they stopped making fun of me and my glasses. I accepted what I was, and I believe God answered my prayers. Clearly, it wasn’t as dramatic as healing the crippled woman, but it was no less meaningful. I felt comfortable in my own skin and what I was. I didn’t desire to be someone else, and I wasn’t envious that another person had better vision. God made me this way; might as well make the most of it.
I’ve realized that life will throw many difficulties our way, which might cripple us – mentally, physically, and even spiritually. As with many aspects of Christianity, it’s how we respond to these crippling setbacks that test our resolve and faith.  Will we respond to these setbacks like Christ and rise to the occasion regardless of the outcome...or will we deal with the problem tomorrow?
#### Questions for Meditation
1. Be mindful of the next thing you procrastinate. Ask yourself, “what is the root of my procrastination?” and “why can’t I do it now?”
2. In what ways have you felt crippled before? And now, looking back, how have you realized that God healed you perhaps in a way that you didn't expect?

## Healing a Man Born Blind
### Published on Mar 20 2013 by Siby Thomas, St. Gregorios Orthodox Church, Houston, TX, 405-334-3379, siby84@gmail.com
John 9:1-41
Of the five senses in the human body, our sight may be the most important to us. Try to close your eyes and do a daily chore and see how you struggle. If you think it’s a pain, then imagine living an entire life without the ability to see. I wouldn’t even want to imagine such a life. Today’s passage talks about a person who was born blind and thus had to beg for a living, but when Jesus arrived on the scene, this blind man's life drastically changed. Not only did he see with his physical eyes, but also he had an unambiguous spiritual view of Christ. We generally look for natural or medicinal means to treat our physical ailments, but in the Word of God, we discover a healing that is divine. A healing where God is totally and directly involved. This is the kind of healing Jesus did! Yes, our Lord performed miracles in order to meet human needs, but He also used them as a means to confirm the truth of the words He spoke. The prophet Isaiah predicted that when the Messiah would come, He would do many miracles. The Messiah would be someone special, the “Son of God”. We are told that He would “open eyes that are blind” (Isaiah 42:7). John 9 is a powerful illustration and confirmation of Jesus’ prior claim, “I am the light of the world. He who follows Me, shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life”. (Jn 8:12).
The Disciples' View of the Blind Man: (Jn 9:1-2)
The disciples’ question comes from what they had learned from the Rabbis, i.e., all disease and suffering is the direct result of sin (also a concept seen among various other cultures/religions). Such an idea fails to see the entire point of the book of Job. It is not “Why do people suffer?” but “Will you be true to God when you do not understand the reason for your suffering?” The disciples wanted to know how this case fit into what they already believed. Sadly, they did not look upon the man as an object of mercy or a sufferer to be relieved, but rather as a kind of puzzle to be solved.
Reflection: Isn’t it very easy for us to see a need in someone's life and refrain from doing anything? Don’t we look at someone’s needs and judge they are in that situation because of some sin or bad judgment? Aren’t we good at making excuses to help us avoid responsibility when it comes to helping others?
The Lord's View of the Blind Man: (Jn 9:3-5)
Jesus both answers their question and helps them to see a broader issue. His words do not explain the cause of the man's blindness, but the purpose. He sees in the blind man an opportunity to display the works of God. When we see suffering, do we see it as a problem or a possibility? If someone close to us suffers from physical or mental impairment, what do we see in that person?
Reflection: In our daily lives, when we are surrounded by agony, pain, or suffering, do we see a problem, a hassle, an inconvenience, or do we see an opportunity to display the works of God?
The Healing Effect of Obedience: (Jn 9:6-7)
We have seen the blind man from the disciples’ perspective, and more clearly, from the Lord’s perspective, now let’s put ourselves behind the darkened eyes of the blind man. Put yourself in his place for a moment. His hearing is just fine. How would you feel, hearing people talk about your spiritual condition with no concern at all for your thoughts? The blind man put them all to silence though, he did not have a careless concern for his condition, he went out and did exactly as Jesus instructed and returned back with his eyesight. This healing also tells us something about Jesus. He always backed up His claims with application. It is one thing to say, “I am the light of the world” and another thing to demonstrate the power to take away the darkness. Similarly, it is one thing to say we are Christians, and another thing to be a Christian.
Symbolic: The way in which Jesus healed the blind man may seem a bit strange. He spat in the dirt, made clay, and smeared the clay on the man’s eyes. He then sent the man to the pool of Siloam, to wash the clay off. Many Church Fathers say He used clay to remind us that He made Adam from clay, and ordered the man to wash in a pool as an image of Holy Baptism (Genesis 2:7). But why did He use spit, rather than water, to make the clay? To this, St. John Chrysostom answers, “You might learn that the power proceeds from His mouth”.
Reflection: Do we have the courage, discipline and faith to follow His will without questioning it?
The People's Reaction: (Jn 9:8-12)
The miracle was so incredible that the people could not believe their eyes. What is disturbing, though, is that no one seems to be rejoicing with the formerly blind man. They asked only, “Where is He?” (Jesus), thinking maybe He had something for them too. The little phrase, “Rejoice with those who rejoice”, (Ro 12:15) is difficult for the worldly-minded who are focused on their own interests.
Reflection:  We need to understand that not everyone will be excited about our new life as a follower of Christ. On the contrary, when we see the work of Christ in someone, do we join him or her in thanking and glorifying the Almighty Lord?
The Pharisees’ Reaction: (Jn 9:13-41)
When the man’s neighbors took him to the Pharisees to show them the result of Jesus’ works, the Pharisees were angry that this supposed healing occurred on the Sabbath. They at first did not believe the man had been blind, but after his parents confirmed the disability, they refused to give Jesus credit for the miracle, saying it was impossible because Jesus was a sinner. The formerly blind man thought this was ridiculous: since Jesus performed an unprecedented miracle, it was obvious He was from God. In fact, when Jesus later pointed out to the man that it was the Son of God Who healed him, the man responded, ‘Lord, I believe!’ and he worshipped Him. Jesus then used this incident to talk about spiritual sight. Jesus came into the world so that those who did not know Him - who were spiritually blind - might “see” and come into communion with Him; in contrast, however, those who know of Christ but reject Him are in effect “made blind”. Unfortunately, because the Pharisees claimed to see the truth and yet nonetheless rejected Christ, Jesus said that their sin remained.
Reflection: St. John Chrysostom thus summarizes this teaching. He speaks of two recoveries of sight and two types of blindness: one sensory and the other spiritual...But they (the Pharisees) were intent only on the sensory things and were ashamed only of sensory blindness... “But now you say ‘We see’, but you do not see at all”. He shows that what they considered as so great and praiseworthy actually brought them punishment instead.
If you are living in darkness today, there is no reason why you cannot learn from the example of this formerly blind man. Have you been washed and received your sight this Lenten season? Why are you waiting? In these few days left before Holy Week, let us unveil the spiritual blindness that covers our sight, thought, mind and heart and repent wholeheartedly to our merciful Lord.

## The Lord's Entry Into Jerusalem
### Published on Mar 27 2013 for the Feast of The Lord's Entry Into Jerusalem (Palm Sunday), we share the sermon of Metropolitan Anthony Bloom of the Russian Orthodox Church.
In the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.
Today Christ enters the path not only of His sufferings but of that dreadful loneliness which enshrouds Him during all the days of Passion week. The loneliness begins with a misunderstanding; the people expect that the Lord’s entry into Jerusalem will be the triumphant procession of a political leader, of a leader who will free his people from oppression, from slavery, from what they consider godlessness – because all paganism or idol-worship is a denial of the living God. The loneliness will develop further into the dreadful loneliness of not being understood even by His disciples. At the Last Supper when the Saviour talks to them for the last time, they will be in constant doubt as to the meaning of His words. And later when He goes into the Garden of Gethsemane before the fearful death that is facing Him, His closest disciples, Peter, John and James – whom He chose to go with Him fall asleep, depressed, tired, hopeless. The culmination of this loneliness will be Christ’s cry on the cross, “My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken me?” Abandoned men, rejected by the people of Israel He encounters the extreme of forsakenness and dies without God, without men, alone, with only His love for God and His love for mankind, dying for its sake and for God’s glory.
The beginning of Christ’s Passion is today’s triumphal procession; the people expected a king, a leader – and they found the Saviour of their souls. Nothing embitters a person so much as a lost, a disappointed hope; and that explains why people who could receive Him like that, who witnessed the raising of Lazarus, who saw Christ’s miracles and heard His teaching, admired every word, who were ready to become His disciples as long as He brought victory, broke away from Him, turned their backs on Him and a few days later shouted, “Crucify Him, crucify Him.” And Christ spent all those days in loneliness, knowing what was in store for Him, abandoned by every one except the Mother of God, who stood silently by, as she had done throughout her life, participating in His tragic ascent to the Cross; she who had accepted the Annunciation, the Good Tidings, but who also accepted in silence Simeon’s prophecy that a sword would pierce her heart.
During the coming days we shall be present – not just remember, but be present – at Christ’s Passion. We shall be part of the crowd surrounding Christ and the disciples and the Mother of God; as we hear the Gospel readings, as we listen to the prayers of the Church, as one image after another of these days of the Passion passes before our eyes, let each one of us ask himself the question, “Where do I stand, who am I in this crowd? A Pharisee? A Scribe? A traitor, a coward? Who? Or do I stand among the Apostles?” But they too were overcome by fear. Peter denied Him thrice, Judas betrayed Him, John, James and Peter went to sleep just when Christ most needed human love and support; the other disciples fled; no one remained except John and the Mother of God, those who were bound to Him by the kind of love which fears nothing and is ready to share in everything.
Once more let us ask ourselves who we are and where we stand, what our position in this crowd is. Do we stand with hope or despair, or what? And if we stand with indifference, we too are part of that terrifying crowd that surrounded Christ, shuffling, listening, and then going away; as we shall go away from church. The Crucifix will be standing here on Thursday and we shall be reading the Gospel about the Cross, the Crucifixion and death – and then what will happen? The Cross will remain standing, but we shall go away for a rest, go home to have supper, to sleep, to prepare for the fatigues of the next day. And during this time Christ is on the Cross, Christ is in the tomb. How awful it is that, like the disciples in their day, we are not able to spend one night, one hour with Him. Let us think about this, and if we are incapable of doing anything, let us at least realise who we are and where we stand, and at the final hour turn to Christ with the cry, the appeal of the thief, Remember me, Lord, in Thy Kingdom. Amen.

## Christ is Risen!
### Published on Apr 03 2013 by Dr. Gina Joshua, St. Thomas Indian Orthodox Church of Baltimore
“He is not here; he has risen, just as he said.” (Matthew 28:1-20)
Resurrection-of-ChristHave you ever thought what it would be like if Jesus lived in the world we do today?  Can you imagine the ‘Facebook Statuses’ about His entry into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday?  The “Tweets” about His crucifixion?  The ‘Instagram Photos’ of the empty tomb?  #ChristIsRisen  #YOLOExceptJesus #Disciple4LifeGetLikeMe
I laugh to myself just thinking about the world we live in where we can follow current events based on social media updates.  And if Jesus lived in the world we do today, I bet He would have tons of Twitter followers!  The good news is that social media does not take away from the importance of the life of Christ.  The death and resurrection of our Lord are the most important events in the life of a Christian.  What happened on Easter is the foundation of our faith.  When the two Mary’s went to see the tomb in early morning after the Sabbath after the crucifixion, they expected to see Jesus’ dead body. Instead, the angels said to them, “…Why do you look for the living among the dead?” Luke 24: 5.  Is that what we do too?  When we look for Christ, do we stop at just His death on the Cross?
Isn’t there more?
We are special because we have a Christ who loves us so much that He died on the cross for us.  And when Christ was buried, our sins were buried there as well.  Through Christ’s suffering on the cross, we were given victory.  But our story does not and should not end there.  We do not serve a dead Christ.  “He is not here, he is risen; just as He said.” Matthew 28: 6.  It was in His plan all along! We serve a living Christ and it is through the power of the Resurrection that we have to know that we are not alone.
Easter and the Resurrection are so much more than we think.  We spent 50 days refraining ourselves from eating meat, from spending time on Facebook, from going out.  We spent 50 days in routine prayer and meditation.  But the empty tomb is not the conclusion and when Christ rose from the dead, it was not so that we could just go back to our daily routine.  It is time we start to live the life that God has planned for us.  Otherwise…why did He die on the cross?  Think about it. We are disciples of a Christ who destroyed death!  He destroyed Satan!  And He did this so we could be united with Him in this power of the resurrection.
I realize that your life might not be 100% perfect in your eyes (I know mine is not!).  But if we looked at ourselves the way our Lord looks at us, then we have to realize that God chose us.  God doesn’t make mistakes.  “If God is for us, who can be against us?” Romans 8:31.
Our Lord has done His part and it is now up to us to take the power of the resurrection and live without self-imposed limits.  Thinking about God’s plans for our life reminds me of my own winding journey.  When I was growing up, I was convinced that I was going to grow up to be a physician. I liked helping people. I liked science. I didn’t get grossed out when I watched the TV show ‘ER.’  Medicine was for me! I told everyone I saw and smiled when I saw their nods of approval.  So when I was in middle school, I remember my Thirumeni Appachen (the late H.G. Dr. Geevarghese Mar Osthathios) asking me, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” I smiled and gave my usual answer and waited for his smile and approval.  Instead, Thirumeni Appachen looked at me and said “No. Gina, you must change your prayer. You should pray that you will be whatever God wants for you to be.”  I did not realize it then but Appachens and Ammachis are so smart!  So I changed my prayer.  “Lord, I trust you and pray that Your will be done.”  So amazingly enough, when I stopped limiting God…He did show me that I was going to be a doctor…of teeth!  And for me, it is so much better than what I could ever imagine!  And that’s how awesome God is.
There is no doubt that the power of the Resurrection will let you move mountains.  Take your faith and let the risen Christ work in your own life.  So what do you do when His plan includes trials, tribulations and doubt?  Pray! Give control to the Lord.  Because our living Christ is limitless.  Our living Christ tells us not to fear because through His death we have new life. 
So take up the cross and follow Christ.  Pray BIG.  Allow Christ to work in your life.  And let yourself be surprised and comforted by the power of Christ.  “…And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” Matthew 28:20.
Christ is Risen! Indeed He is Risen!
For Meditation
1. Are you limiting yourself?  What is holding you back from giving God control of your life?
2. How will you continue the goals you had for Lent now that Lent is over?

## St. Thomas Sunday
### Published on Apr 11 2013
St. John 20: 19-31
Have you ever experienced a time when you were scared, challenged, intimidated or just plain didn’t know what was happening? How did you react in that situation? Did you run, hide, disassociate yourself, get upset or cry? In this Gospel we see how the apostles reacted to Christ’s Resurrection.
By vs. 19, the disciples have already heard about Christ’s Resurrection from Mary Magdalene earlier in the day. Then we see the disciples huddled together behind closed doors “for fear of the Jews.” Despite their choice to avoid any sort of confrontation, Jesus comes and meets them where they are and He shows them His wounds; reminding them of who He is. Christ doesn’t scold, isn’t disappointed, but encourages them and gives them a command; “As the Father has sent Me, I also send you”. Hearing this, the disciples don’t wait and come up with a plan or weigh their options, but they go and tell Thomas about what they saw. Let me remind you, that these were the same people who moments ago were hiding fearfully. The disciples didn’t keep what they saw to themselves. They ran the risk of being mocked or being seen as crazy, but they told others about Christ’s Resurrection anyway.
Hearing the disciples testimonies, Thomas responds that He will not believe until he sees and touches Christ’s wounds. Eight days later, Christ visits the disciples and now Thomas was with them. He tells Thomas, “Reach your finger here, and look at My hands; and reach your hand here, and put it into My side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing.” Then Thomas confesses a profound truth; “My Lord and My God!” We see three things here; Thomas seeking Christ (Truth), his declaration of his faith and Christ’s response towards him. The Gospel reading doesn’t indicate if Thomas touched Christ’s wounds, but seeing Christ in front of him was enough for Thomas to believe. Thomas acknowledges that the man in front of him is indeed God and the person to whom He will submit his life. Today, we know him as the disciple that came to India to spread the Gospel. The fact that he came to India shows the depth of his belief; it has to be an irrefutable Truth for someone to risk their life for it. Today, we are benefactors of his faith; through his belief, multitudes know Christ. Last but not least, we see how patient Christ is with his disciples. This reminded me of many instances when I was unbelieving as well. In those moments, Christ patiently waited for me; He was faithful even when I was not. Similarly, haven’t Christ been patient with you when you didn’t believe?
Throughout this Gospel we see the disciples and those who knew Christ, slowly coming to a fuller understanding of Christ. The disciples heard about Christ’s Resurrection from others, but hadn’t fully believed or understood until they themselves experienced Christ. So, let us not just hear of Christ, but, as the disciples, let us experience Him. Let us not stay in our unbelief, but like Thomas, let us seek Him, experience Him, be convicted and live a life that glorifies Him. Let us be receptive to Christ, so that we too, like the disciples can be vessels for Christ!
#### Questions for Meditation
1) In your unbelieving moments, what do you do?
2) How can we be more receptive to Christ?

## It is the Lord!
### Published on Apr 17 2013 by Steven Kurian, St. Thomas Indian Orthodox Church of Philadelphia, stevekurian@yahoo.com
St. John 21:1-14
Today’s devotional is based on the Gospel reading from the 2nd Sunday after the glorious Feast of the Resurrection. In this reading from St. John’s Gospel (21:1-13), we see the assembled Apostles returned to their normal day-to-day lives; fishing in the Sea of Tiberias (Galilee). After an unsuccessful evening of casting their nets, the risen Lord Jesus Christ greets the group but yet is not recognized by them. When the disciples follow the instructions of this “stranger” to cast their nets on the right side of their boat, their nets suddenly become overflowing with fish. Upon experiencing firsthand this miracle, the Apostle Peter immediately recognizes the Lord and promptly dives into the sea to swim to his Savior on the shore. When we see this example of St. Peter’s eagerness to meet the Lord, let us ask ourselves if we are able to imitate this act of faith. Are we willing to drop all of our cares and earnestly pursue the Lord without having a second thought in our minds?
In the Gospel of St. Luke, we see the type of commitment Christ asks of us if we are to truly and whole-heartedly follow him. When a potential follower tells Jesus that he would follow him but would first have to say farewell to his friends and family, the Lord replies that “No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God” (Luke 9: 62). In the same way that St. Peter would be willing to forget about his boat, his fishing, and his friends; in the same way that no one can plow his fields while looking back, we are called to seek Christ and His Kingdom. This, of course, is not to say that we shouldn’t pay heed to our daily lives: our studies, our work, or our families; but rather, Christ instructs us that the primary objective of our lives is to seek first the Kingdom of God and our other concerns will be resolved according to God’s will (Matthew 6:33). If we are really “Christian” people, followers of Christ, we must single-mindedly follow Christ at all times and in every facet of our lives. We are followers and seekers of Christ not only when we are worshipping at Church, but when we are working in our offices, exercising in our gyms, socializing with our friends, or otherwise whatever we do every day of our lives.
Knowing this, that we are called to pursue the Risen Lord primarily before all other things, we must understand also that the world is once again becoming a place that does not know or understand Christ. We must be resolved and emboldened to go after Christ, like St. Peter in the Sea of Galilee, even if that scandalizes us in the eyes of this world. St. Peter’s and the other Apostles’ lifelong pursuit of Christ led them to evangelize the world and eventually be martyred by it. While we may or may not be called to martyrdom, we certainly must be prepared to singularly follow Christ regardless of the consequences. We may have to look foolish, be made outcast, and even be persecuted by this world, but if we truly are focused on Christ as our preeminent end-goal, all these other cares will not matter. That being said, aside from Christ, is there anything else we really need?
#### Questions for Meditation 
1) Do you find yourself worshipping only on Sundays and leaving God there? In what ways can you choose to follow Him throughout your day? 
2) What are some of your cares that you might have trouble letting go of if asked to pursue the Lord fully?

## Loving Christ Above All Else
### Published on Apr 25 2013 by Rev. Fr. Sujit T. Thomas, St. Paul’s Orthodox Church, Albany, 516-754-0743, stthomas8@yahoo.com
Third Sunday After Easter
St. John 21:15-19
This Sunday’s reading is a continuation of last week’s reading. It is the only account in the four gospels of this miraculous catch and the ensuing conversation. Christ reinstates Peter to the Apostolic ministry. During the passion of Christ, Peter had denied Christ three times; in a parallel fashion Christ asks three times to Peter about his love for Christ. This reading reminds us of the deep love that we ought to have for Christ. Above all Christ wants us to love him. This love that we give to Christ is a love in return for the love that he has offered to us. It is in return for the salvation that Christ has brought for us through is death and resurrection. Through our Lord’s passion and resurrection he has given us a strength beyond any power in this world. We say along with the Psalmist, “I love you, O Lord, my strength” (Psalm 18:1).
The love that Christ requires of us is absolute love that sees everything else as futile. It is a love that costs everything else in this world. That is why Christ probes Peter and asks, “Do you love me more than these?” Peter must confess that there is nothing else in this world that is of more value to his life than Christ. Christ had already warned, "whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me” (Matthew 10:37).
This is a question that Our Lord asks of each of us. Do you love Christ more than everything else in our life? Is there anything in our life that stands between our love for our Lord.  In the same manner as King David we ought to be people after the heart of God.  In his Devotional work Imitation of Christ, Thomas A Kempis states, “You will quickly be deceived if you look only to the outward appearance of men, and you will often be disappointed if you seek comfort and gain in them. If, however, you seek Jesus in all things, you will surely find Him.”
#### Questions for Meditation
1) What or who do we love the most in our life?
2) If we love Christ, how do we express that love?

## The Road to Emmaus
### Published on May 16 2013 by Subin Konglathu, St. Gregorios Orthodox Church, San Francisco, CA, subin_jk@yahoo.com
Luke 24:13-35
Imagine for a moment, the hopelessness these two companions felt, as they started their seven mile journey to Emmaus.  Our Lord had assured them that though He must leave them, He would not leave them comfortless.  He had promised them that the Spirit of Truth would guide, comfort and strengthen them. Yet, after His death we find these men sad, fearful, perplexed, defeated and in retreat, with no sense of mission or purpose.  Why were they leaving Jerusalem even after hearing of the empty tomb?  They saw their master’s suffering - the deep wounds on His body, the blood, the pain in His eyes as He cried out “It is finished”.  They could not believe that the man who died a criminal’s death could be their Saviour.  They failed to understand God’s plan of redemption, that the seed of the woman will crush the serpent’s head. (Genesis 3:15).
Is this not our own struggle? When faced with the difficulties of life we find ourselves walking away from God and doubting His faithfulness. We carry our burdens alone, upon our shoulders, unwilling to surrender them to the One who can give us rest. We do not trust that He will do above and beyond all that we ask or think (Ephesians 3:20).
In His infinite wisdom, the Risen Lord kept these two men from recognizing Him in order to teach them that His presence was always with them and to explain to them what was said in the scriptures concerning Himself.  A fire grew within their hearts as they heard the Truth which was spoken to them. Their hearts once again fill with hope -faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of God (Romans 10:17).
They realized it was the Lord only when He broke the bread, only when they had communion with Him.   His proclamation of the Scriptures has prepared their hearts to receive the Truth, the Risen Lord.  Likewise, we need to hear and receive the Holy Scripture faithfully, in order for the fire to burn within us. If we ignore the Word of God, we resist the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, and eventually the fire dies out.
Do not let despair and hopelessness blind you to the presence of the our Risen Lord.  Do not let your walk be to Emmaus - a walk alone in darkness, but instead return to Jerusalem -  a place of comfort, strength and rest, and let your hearts burn with joy. 
#### Meditation:
1) As you walk the road of life, do you experience the Lord Jesus as your companion and fellow traveler?
2)In verse 25 Jesus calls these men foolish and slow of heart to believe.  Why?  Is this applicable in your life?

“… someone said to Him, “I will follow You wherever You go.”  And Jesus said to him, “The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.” 
And He said to another, “Follow Me.” - Luke 9: 57-59
Have you ever gotten yourself into something before you completely knew what it was that you were volunteering for?  I’ve gotten myself into this situation many times.  I’m one of those people that don’t like to back out of something once I’ve agreed to it.  A perfect example of this is one of my experiences when I was away at college.  One day while I was leaving the campus center, I saw another student struggling to open the door to leave right behind me.  He was struggling a bit because he was trying to balance his computer monitor on top of his desktop tower.  Now, at the expense of being considered old, this was a time when laptops weren’t too common and computer monitors were a bit bulkier than they are today. Being somewhat courteous, I held the door open for him.  He politely said thank you, and was starting to continue on his way.  I felt badly for him, so I asked him if he needed help carrying something.  He hesitated a little and then warned me that he was transporting this back to his dorm room, which not only happened to be in a tower, but on a completely different part of the campus than I was heading to, which was a lot farther than where we were.  This was not what I was expecting, but being who I was, and not wanting to back down, I tightened my shoulder strap grabbed the monitor right off the computer tower and said “let’s go”.
It might seem a small thing, but he was grateful for the help.  Looking back on it, I have a lot of questions about that moment.  If I had known that he was going so far, would I have offered to help carry his burden?  If I didn’t care about looking like a jerk, would I have said, “well… that’s out of my way, so you’re on your own?”  If I was on my way to go study or more likely, play basketball at the gym, would I have offered help?  If I knew everything my offer of help entailed, would I still ask?
In the passage from St. Luke above, a man walking with Jesus says to Him, “I will follow You wherever You go.”  Did this man have any idea what he was offering Jesus?  No.  That’s why Jesus responds the way he does.
And Jesus said to him, “The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.” 
It isn’t clear exactly who this person is, but it is clear that this man had no idea the path that Jesus was going to travel.  Jesus is explaining to him, that even the beasts of the field and the birds of the air have a place to call home, but Jesus Himself didn’t even have a bed to call His own.  Jesus wasn’t speaking a riddle, rather, He was warning this man not to offer something that He wasn’t prepared to.  Jesus was warning him that the path to follow Him is not an easy one.
I remember clearly one of the first times I offered my services to God and the church; it was as an altar boy.  Like the man that offered to follow Jesus, I don’t think I clearly understood the responsibility of what I was offering because the very same day I was brought into the altar, was the very same day I got into trouble for running around after the service making too much noise outside the church and not being a good role model.  But the first time that I felt that God call out to me to follow Him, was different.  It was during a sermon that I heard many years ago on that same college campus.  And I remember feeling the weight of the offer, the heaviness of both the question and the answer.  “Will you follow Me?”  Now, to say that because I was a little older, I completely understood what God was asking of me is foolish, but I answered yes anyway.  I answered yes to follow Him; yes to be held more accountable to the calling that was instilled in me long ago.  I answered yes to follow Jesus and abide in Him.  I answered yes, not because He offered me a place to lay my head or a comfortable lifestyle, but because He promised the forgiveness of sins and the gift of everlasting life.  How could anyone refuse?
I won’t be arrogant to say that I know the full weight of what it means to follow Him, after all, I’m still struggling to follow Him daily.  But I do know this; I don’t regret helping that other student with his computer, it felt good to help.  And I definitely don’t regret accepting Jesus’ call to follow Him, it is good to be a follower of Jesus Christ.
#### Questions for Meditation
1) Have you ever volunteered for something not fully knowing what was expected of you?  Why?
2) Have you ever truly understood what it means to follow Jesus?  What is it in your life that holds you back?

## We, the Church: The Fragrant Rose Amidst the Thorns
### Published on May 16 2013 by Tim Jacob, Toronto (St. Gregorios, Mississauga)
John 17: 13 – 26
One of the most common types of questions one hears during youth meetings and conferences or even discussions with our priests in our parishes revolves around the concept of Orthopraxis: the correct way of living and being. How does one live in the world as Orthodox Christians with integrity amidst the tumultuous currents in our everyday lives. Whether it is dealing with the spiritual slackness and disillusionment that unfortunately comes with a hectic academic life or whether it is dealing with a painful breakup or whether it is dealing with problems in the home with one’s parents or siblings, our faith in Christ is constantly put to the test from all sides. In the midst of this chaos, it is comforting to see from this week’s readings that our Lord knew just what would befall many of us in the years to come. He prayed not just for his apostles, but also for us, for “those who will believe in me though their message” (St. John 17:20) and he prayed to not “take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one” (St. John17:15). Why, one asks? Why be so cruel, when He could redeem us in the blink of an eye and save us the trouble of living through the problems this world offers. We are offered but a small glimpse of this answer in this text. Our Lord says to the Father: “As you sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world” (John 17:18). It is in this little passage that we begin to see the “big picture”, so to speak. Like Christ who was sent by the Father for the saving of the world and lived through the countless pains and sorrows, we as the Church are also born and called to live out that very same life of Christ in its fullness. In other words, we are called to be Christ.
The prayer of our Lord from this part of Holy Scripture paints a challenging but beautiful picture of Christian life and by extension, the Church. The hope of Christ, for us to stay in the world and yet not be consumed by evil ought to encourage us to contemplate on a particular flower of deep symbolic value in the Holy Scriptures. One of the most beautiful Old Testament images of Christ and the Church is that of the Rose of Sharon and the Lilly among the thorns in Song of Songs 2:1 – 2. St. Ambrose, commenting on this passage, speaks of our Lord as the rose which, though his suffering on the Cross, “when cut, keeps its odor, and when bruised increases it, nor if torn off does it lose it”.[1] St. Gregory the Great, commenting on the same passage, sees Solomon prophesying of the Church, calling it the Lily among the thorns, where “the good did not refuse to bear with the bad”.[2] As we can clearly see from these two Fathers, we the Church, in our life and mission are inextricably tied to the mission and life of Christ. We, who are sent into the world, in our keeping away from the evil one, are called to be the roses in the world’s garden, where we emit that sweet fragrance of Christ (cf. 2 Corinthians 2:15) amidst the thorns, amidst our own failings, amidst the failings of our world and amidst the failures of those around us. As the Cross reminds us, God can still use us to spread his sweet fragrance to areas yet unknown, even as we suffer from our innumerable cuts and bruises. Surely then, it is only by living in a suffering world that we can begin to start sharing in that glory spoken of in John17:22, which Christ has given us. Lastly, this prayer of our Lord gives us a brief glimpse into the Lord’s vision of the vocation of the Church. We are sent by Christ just as he was sent and we are to live and be raised in the world just as the Lord lived and was raised in the world. Through this affiliation with both the world and God, through it being united with one another and with God (cf. John 17: 22 – 23), the Church stands in the world as Christ himself, revealing to the world that God has sent Him (cf. John 17:21), and intercedes on their behalf to give them a fighting chance against the evil one, sin and death. Our dear father, His Grace Paulos Mar Gregorios of blessed memory, said it best when he said that,
“The Church is the priest of the world. The world does not know God; is unable to approach God. But the Church does know, not because it is wiser or holier, but because God has called it to know him intimately...The Church should stand on the Holy Mountain, on behalf of the world, conscious of their needs, interceding for them, in full identification with them”.[3]
#### Questions for Meditation:
1) Reflect on the troubles that plague you the most? What are the “thorns” that plague your relationship with God and how does the prayer of our Lord speak to you, personally?
2) As Christ’s prayer is for us to be sent out into the world and be in the world as he was, what can we do to reflect this hope in our neighbourhoods as Orthodox Christians? What can we, the Church, do in our world as MGOCSM members that can reflect our intercession for the world in the midst of the evils that surround us?

## The Feast of Pentecost
### Published on May 29 2013 by Very Rev. Fr. Michael Hatcher, Cor Episcopos, Seattle/Edmonton (St. Gregorios, Spokane, Washington), gulmohr.stgregorios@gmail.com
St. John 15:1-14
Pentecost is a great feast in the Orthodox Church, representing the “Birthday of the Church,” when we remember the Apostles are anointed by the Holy Spirit, descending in the form of tongues of fire. The Apostles, suddenly able to speak and be understood in other languages, preach to the vast crowds assembled for the feast in Jerusalem, and about three thousand souls are baptized and added to the new Church. (See Acts, Chapter 2.)
Because of the powerful presence of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost, we are reminded of the central doctrine of our Church: The Holy Trinity. God manifests himself to us in three distinct persons- Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, who at the same time are one, true God, “Had Aloho Shareero,” as we say in Syriac. That is why we have the kneeling prayers, dedicated to each person of the Holy Trinity on Pentecost Sunday.
Most of us are very aware of God the Father, who we associate with the creation of the universe, and of Jesus Christ, God become man, who offers himself for our salvation. But we seldom dwell on the presence of the Holy Spirit, who is with us every day, to sustain us in life, and to make the sacraments, or mysteries of the Holy Church effective. The Holy Spirit, whom we received in our baptism and Chrismation, is constantly with us. He inspires us to pray, to do good works. He moves our consciences to seek forgiveness for what we have done wrong, or failed to do when we had the opportunity to help another person.
Our Lord speaks to us about the Holy Spirit in the Gospel read during the Holy Qurbana for Pentecost (John16:1-15). He refers to the Holy Spirit as the “Helper.” In fact, that is exactly what the Holy Spirit is. He is God With Us- each day subtly giving us life. He changes the Bread and Wine offered at the Holy Qurbana to the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. (The fluttering of the priest’s hands symbolizes the Holy Spirit at work.)
We have a great gift in the Holy Spirit, which was only given to certain people, mostly prophets, in the Old Testament. Now, every Christian who has received the sacrament of Chrismation has the gift of the Holy Spirit. That is why the Holy Spirit is sometimes called the “Father of the Poor,” because all people, no matter what their circumstances in life, can receive the great gift of His presence.
We must ask the Holy Spirit to be with us, to help us see Christ in other people, to give us the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which include wisdom, understanding, right judgment, courage, knowledge, piety and fear of the Lord. May we always appreciate the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, and leads us to holiness, if we are open to Him in our life.

## Why Do You Seek God?
### Published on May 29 2013 by Bijoy Thomas, St. Mary’s Malankara Orthodox Church of Dallas (Farmers Branch, TX), bijoy.thomas@live.com
St. John 6:26-35
Towards the end of last Sunday’s Gospel reading, we read that Jesus declares Himself to be “the bread of life”. This statement lies at the very core of our faith and is the unshakable truth upon which the sacrament of Holy Qurbana is celebrated.
However, in the beginning of the Gospel reading we read that Jesus tells the crowd about their intentions behind following Him. He says that the crowd followed Him because He fed them quite well with bread and fish (and had left overs too!). It is quite easy for us to dismiss this portion of the reading when compared to the very bold and profound statements towards the end of the reading. But in my mind, this question that Jesus asks them – Why do you follow me? – is a question we should be asking ourselves every day.
Why do we seek God? What are our intentions when we pray to Him? I had never thought too deeply about these questions until one day when I read a book called Beginning to Pray by Fr. Anthony Bloom. In that book, Fr. Anthony clearly states the reason why you and I pray. We pray to God because we want something from Him and not Him. Is that a relationship? Do we behave in that way with our friends? Do we aim at what friendship can give us or is it the friend whom we love?
Let us think of our prayers, yours and mine; think of the warmth, the depth and intensity of our prayer when it concerns someone we love or something that matters to us. We put forth all our requests with many tears and fervent prayers.  Our heart is open and all our inner self is focused. Does it mean that God matters to you? No, it does not. It simply means that the subject matter of your prayer (a person or situation in our life) matters to you.
This is the same way the crowd felt about God. They knew that He could feed, heal and provide for them. But they did not want Him. And this is when Jesus corrects their thinking and tells them to labor for the food that does not perish. This instruction is repeated in a lot of places in the Bible. We see that in Mathew 6, Jesus questions the crowd asking – Who do you worry about what you shall eat or with what you shall be clothed. For you Heavenly Father knows you need all these things.  But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
Does this mean that we should not ask God for our needs and His Help? Absolutely not! But is should not be the only reason we seek God. We should seek God for who He is and why He matters to us. Everything else is secondary. When we sit down to pray, let us collect our thoughts on the Holiness of the one triune God before whom we come and his immeasurable love that we beseech. When our mind wanders, lets us remember what God instructs the psalmist – “Be still and know that I am God!”.  Let us seek God for the life giving bread He offers and not for the worldly bread that satisfies our stomach.
#### Questions for Meditation:
1) What distracts us the most when we pray? Are you praying at a time when your mind is calm and focused? Or is it right after a TV show, or dinner? Do you follow a prayer discipline?
2) Do you practice quiet time with God - a time when you can recollect the entire events of the day? This is a time to think about how you behaved towards others or reacted to certain situations. Think of it as a one on one conversation with God where you narrate the things you did or thought and how you could have done it better. Ask God for His help in becoming the person He wants you to be.

## Take Nothing
### Published on Jun 06 2013 by Pincy Jacob, St. Mary’s, Linden, NJ, pincy.jacob@gmail.com
St. Matthew 10:5-16
“Do not take any gold or silver or copper in your belts, take no bag for the journey or extra tunic or sandals, or a staff; for the worker is worth his keep” St. Matthew 10: 9-10
The first time I read this passage I was taken back. Jesus just called 12 individuals to be His disciples and immediately thereafter instructs them with several strict guidelines.  His disciples were told to take nothing with them-no money, no possessions. How can one go on a journey without the proper provisions? It takes a strong leader to direct his followers with those orders. By giving these guidelines, it portrays to everyone that one can follow Jesus without being wealthy or having possessions. It takes willingness and complete, ultimate surrender of the heart, mind and soul. If you believe in Him and listen to Him, all your needs (physical, mental, and spiritual) will be met.
I remember when I was starting the school year in college and in high school; we were given a list of supplies. I would make it a point to have all my supplies in my book bag on the first day of school-from pens to notebooks to folders, etc.  In college, I even carried my textbooks on the first day of class. My thinking-instructions were given and I had to follow them, I had to come prepared for school. I would get frustrated if I didn’t have all the supplies while my classmates did.  Our parents and teachers always taught us to go to class prepared. Whatever we do in life, we have to be prepared. Imagine my surprise when I read this verse and Jesus said do not take anything. All sorts of questions came to my mind-what will they eat? Where will they sleep? Will they wear the same clothes as the day before? What if their sandals tears? And so on… As I continued in my spiritual journey, I truly understood the meaning of this verse.
In this day and age, we have become so attached to our personal gadgets-phones, iPods, etc. There’s an app for just about anything. What if one day, we leave everything behind? Leave the tech gadgets, money, and our cars at home intentionally. Can we survive? Will others help us? I ride the train in New York City to go to work and I see many times individuals asking others for a swipe-to pay for their ride. Commuters just ignore them and continue walking. We become consumed in our daily lives that we don’t think of those who are in need.  Jesus knew what a daunting task that He put on His disciples yet He gave those guidelines. He made sure that His disciples understood the nature of their task-its not about personal possessions, or wealth-its about trusting in His will to spread the Gospel. That is the only thing that matters and it can be done effectively with simplicity, no brand name clothes, no BMW, no mansions, no cash.
Thousands of years ago Jesus commissioned His disciples. They were ready, willing to go when they were unaware of the power of Jesus. We know through the Scriptures, and the Church Fathers that Jesus had a human and divine nature and yet somehow we cannot leave everything behind. Have we become so accustomed and attached to our luxurious items?
Don’t trouble yourself-there is time-to change your ways-to submit your life to the will of God. Every day, I submit my will to God and He pours His blessings on me abundantly. Jesus commissions each and every one of us to carry our cross. Let’s take a few moments now and every day to reflect on what is important. If Christ and His disciples went on a journey without any provisions, then, we, at a bare minimum can try to leave our luxurious possessions behind and start/continue our journey to the Kingdom of Heaven.
#### Questions for Meditation:
1) Can you give up your possessions if a stranger came to you and said follow me to preach about the Kingdom of Heaven?
2) Is your life a reflection that the Kingdom of Heaven is approaching? What areas of your life can be changed to reflect that?

## Down from Heaven
### Published on Jun 13 2013 by Bincy Thomas, Sts. Basilios-Gregorios Orthodox Church, North Plainfield, NJ
St. John 6:35-46
"And Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. He who comes to Me shall never hunger, and he who believes in Me shall never thirst. But I said to you that you have seen Me and yet do not believe. All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will by no means cast out.  For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me. This is the will of the Father who sent Me, that of all He has given Me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day. And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have everlasting life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
The Jews then complained about Him, because He said, “I am the bread which came down from heaven.” And they said, “Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How is it then that He says, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”
Jesus therefore answered and said to them, “Do not murmur among yourselves. No one can can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day. it is written in the prophets, ‘And they shall all be taught by God.’ Therefore everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me. Not that anyone has seen the Father, except He who is from God; He has seen the Father."
Jesus Christ being the bread of life is a familiar sermon to many of us. In fact, two Sundays ago, a very similar gospel passage was read during Liturgy. But in this week’s portion, I’d like to bring to your attention the question raised amongst the Jewish leaders.
And they said, “Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How is   it then that He says, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”
I’m sure many of us can remember when we were younger spending summer nights playing outdoors after school. One thing my friends and I used to enjoy was staying out till it was dark and spotting lightning bugs. We were attracted to their glow which almost seemed magical. They made the evening dusk look pretty. The best thing was that these fireflies moved slow enough that you can cup your hands and actually catch them. So we would raid our kitchen cabinets for all the glass jars our mothers saved and catch lightning bugs in them.  Of course you would be excited you have your own firefly and keep it as long as could in that airtight container, which was sadly only about 8 hours.
How we treated these fireflies is sometimes the way we treat God – we contain Him in ways that we think we can experience Him best.
Take a look at how the Jewish leaders in the passage contained Christ. They are quick to question Jesus’ identity when He claims that he is the bread that came from heaven. They used their limited knowledge about Him to negate this truth. We see that they were having a hard time accepting Christ to be more than ‘just the son of Joseph and Mary whom they knew’. Their ignorance made me ponder if we too sometimes refuse to see Christ for who He really is, beyond our imperfect understanding of His role and presence in our life.
Is he just a God we beg to perform miracles? Or only praised when our prayers are answered? Or only worshipped on Sundays because our families give us no other choice?
He tells us that He is more than that--- that He is the bread of life. The very sustenance we need for life today and eternal life. He is food that satisfies our every hunger. But do we see Christ as that essential in our daily lives? Or are we settling for less by reducing Him and His works? Take a moment to imagine how different would our relationships would be if we sought Him as our Counselor, our academic life if we sought Him as our Teacher, our health if we sought Him as Healer.
Christ reminds us that He has come to give life, and to give it abundantly.  Let’s make an effort to experience Him in fullness. And be encouraged knowing that Christ and the Church gave us many avenues to accomplish this – the Eucharist, the Scriptural Word, sacramental life, and each other! So, my friends, let us behold the Bread of Life and taste and see that the Lord is good. 
#### Questions for Mediation:
1. Do we find ourselves placing limits on the power of Christ?
2. Where do we look for life? Do we find life in Christ or in other things?

## The Mission of the Chosen
### Published on Jun 19 2013 by Rev. Fr. Christopher Mathew, Former Chicago Area Youth Minister, orthodoxchris@gmail.com
St. Luke 10:1-16)
“…The harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few; therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest. 3 Go your way; behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves.” (St. Luke 10: 2-3)
This past Sunday’s Gospel reading was taken from St. Luke 10.  We hear Jesus commissioning the 70 to preach the gospel, which is a central theme during this time of Pentecost.  This passage has intrigued me every time I hear and read it because Jesus is very specific about the mission.  The Harvest is great, but the laborers are few, and the 70 He is sending is focused on preaching the gospels to the cities.  As we read in verse 4, He tells them to carry no money, no provisions, no sandals; they are not to stop and speak to anyone on the way; their focus is to get to the city and preach.
When I read this, and think about it, I remember all the times that I have asked to myself, how is Jesus calling me to preach the gospel in my life.  I also think of all the times I have heard people say to me that they are confused on how they should present the gospel.  As I reflect on this, I see from this passage Jesus Christ is very clear on what the laborers are to do.  This is why Jesus said that the laborers are few, because how many people stay committed to the goal and mission of the gospel to this level of commitment.
Now we usually find it common to see this level of commitment in other vocations.  If we study the life of most sports stars who are considered great, we see a strong commitment to practice, to train and to push themselves to a level most people are not willing to do. Their commitment does not wane during the off season, but continues for the next season to come.  If we look at people who successful in education, business, medicine, law, politics, or whatever vocation, we find people whose focus remains committed to fulfilling their goal.
What is our goal?  To be with Christ and in the Kingdom, and bring others to Christ and the Kingdom.  We have attained Christ and His Kingdom through our baptism, by partaking in the Body and Blood of Christ.  But are we to stop with ourselves?  When reading this passage we know that the answer is ‘no’.  As Christians we have become part of the chosen, and we have a responsibility and an obligation to Christ and His Church to proclaim the gospel.
How do we accomplish this goal?  When we meditate on this passage from the Gospel we see that Christ is asking His laborers to stay focused on the mission.  Now as we read further in this chapter, these apostles were able to do great things in the name of Jesus.  And these 70 were not just some random men that Jesus drafted.  These 70 were men began by hearing the preaching of Jesus Christ and were able to internalize what Jesus was proclaiming in them.  The Word of God incarnated in their life and they were able to proclaim the kingdom as Jesus had instructed them.
This means first and foremost that we need to make sure we stay connected with the Word of God.  As Orthodox Christians we know we do this by reading the scriptures, and by partaking of Christ’s Body and Blood in the Holy Qurbana.  If we truly seek God by reading and partaking of Him, then we start to see our mission becoming clear.  This also means we have to remove those things that cloud or darken our spiritual sight.  This cloud of darkness is sin itself.  This is why it is important to confess our sins on a regular basis so that when we partake of Holy Qurbana and read the Holy Scriptures, our body, mind and soul can truly listen to God, internalize Him in our life, and share His grace and mercy to all.
#### Questions for Meditation:
1) Take time to sit in silence and think how much time you really take to understand God’s Word.
2) Do you take time to ask other brothers and sisters in Christ to help you understand the Scriptures?
3) When preparing for Holy Qurbana, do you take time to seek God’s wisdom to help you find your mission in proclaiming the Gospel in your life?

## Rely, And Let God Multiply
### Published on Jun 27 2013 by Bobby Varghese, Brooklyn/Queens/Long Island, bvarg556@gmail.com
The Gospel of St. Luke 9:10-17
How awesome are miracles?? Whether it’s as big as raising someone from the dead, or as small as “I can’t believe it’s not butter”, there’s just something about miracles that gives us the “But how?!?!” factor. With that said, the Feeding of the Five Thousand has to be hands down one of my favorite miracles of all time. The reason why I love this miracle so much is because it makes me realize just how weak my faith is. When I am encountered with a problem, whether it’d be at work, church, home, etc., I rely on my intellect, and my intellect alone to help me solve those problems. I use my resources to aid me in the process; I think things through, strategize, and come up with as many possible solutions as I can.
I don’t think I’ve ever gone to God first to help me with a problem I’m faced with. In fact, I’m not sure if a lot of us do. Our first thought is, what can “I” do? How do “I” go about this? How do “I” solve this? Don’t beat yourself up over it though, because in this passage, we see the Apostles doing the same thing. Rather than going to Jesus first, they relied on their own intellect.
What was the problem? Jesus tells the Apostles to give the multitude of approximately five thousand men, something to eat. They have no money and were only able to obtain a measly five loaves of bread and two fish. At most, the five loaves and two fish were only good for about four to five people!  There was no possible way all of these men could be fed with just a limited amount of food.
Realizing they can’t do much of anything else, the Apostles go to Jesus, and in turn, Jesus completely handles the situation. He has the Apostles seat the multitude in groups of fifty, blesses the food, and then has them distribute the food. And there you have it, a seemingly impossible situation turned possible through Christ alone. He took what little He had, and multiplied it to the point where all were satisfied.
All of the wonderful miracles that Jesus performs are meant to show His power, compassion for His children, and to teach us a lesson.
Here, we can take away two lessons from this miracle. First, always rely on God and not on your own intellect. What we think might be right, may not be. Our minds are so limited compared to the power of God.  So, when encountering a situation where you just don’t know what to do, always seek His guidance and wisdom first.
“Trust in God with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding” – Proverbs 3:5.
Another lesson we can take away is that when we give what we have to God, He can take it, bless it, and multiply it!  Even if we have a little bit to offer, that little becomes far greater when placed in the Hands of Jesus. Think about how much God can do with us if we offer ourselves to Him! You may think of yourself to be worth just a loaf of bread, or a piece of fish…..but remember, you can help feed thousands and thousands of people spiritually, that is, if you let God
do so.
Let everything you do, be done in love and for the Glory of God!
#### Questions for Meditation:
1) If you were in the Apostles’ position, would you have handled the situation differently? Why or why not?
2) What have you given God, where He took that very thing, and turned it into a blessing for others?

## Get Out of Your Own Way
### Published on Jul 04 2013 by Samson Thomas, Dallas, Texas
Devotional for the Sixth Sunday After Pentecost – Matthew 15:32-39 – Jesus Feeds the Multitude of Four Thousand
32 Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way." 33 His disciples answered, "Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?" 34 "How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked. "Seven," they replied, "and a few small fish." 35 He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. 36 Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people. 37 They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. 38 The number of those who ate was four thousand, besides women and children. 39 After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan.
As we witnessed last week during the feeding of the five thousand, we once again see the Lord's compassion and the disciples' duty to act on His behalf. While there are many similarities between the two miracles, this week's readings reveal a focus on the role of the disciples - and on our own responsibilities in sharing God's compassion and love.
The lessons that accompanied last week's Gospel emphasized transformation. We heard the reading from the Acts of the Holy Apostles in which Saul was converted to Paul (Acts 9:10-18). Then, in Paul's second letter to the Corinthians, we heard that "if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!" (2 Cor. 5:14-20). These lessons paralleled the transformation of the bread and fish in Luke 9:10-17.
This week, instead of analyzing the multitude, fish, bread, or the miracle itself, let's focus on the disciples and their part in completing the task requested by the Lord.
When the disciples were met with the challenge of feeding the multitude at Decapolis, they panicked and doubted that they would be capable of fulfilling the Lord's wishes (Mt. 15:33). Even after they had already witnessed that through God their five loaves and two fish were more than enough for five thousand, the disciples still lacked faith in what they had.
The Sin of Selfishness
Perhaps the reason for their unease was due to close-minded, inward thoughts. After all, the disciples had been in the desert near Decapolis for three days at this point. In this wilderness, surrounded by Gentiles, it is possible that the disciples were focused on whether or not they even had enough to eat for themselves.
We see this same line of thought in the parable of the talents, where the unprofitable servant hid the one talent he was given. The master in this parable concludes by saying "Everyone who has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Mt. 25:29-30).
Unfortunately for one of the disciples, the punishment endured by the worthless servant became a reality, as seen in this week's lesson from the Book of Acts 1:15-20. St. Peter recounts the demise of Judas Iscariot, a man whose selfishness caused him to use the gift of discipleship to betray Jesus. From this reading, we learn that Judas' inability to use discipleship for good led him to desolation and suffering.
The Folly of Worldly Knowledge
It is also possible that the disciples were unable to find a practical or logical solution to the situation they faced. Instead of being motivated by love and compassion, the disciples were driven by what they thought they knew. Their flawed understanding of the task at hand caused them to hesitate. As we learned in this week's Pauline Epistle, "The man who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know. But the man who loves God is known by God" (1 Cor. 8:2-3).
Relying on God and Love
Whether the disciples' discomfort was due to their incomplete knowledge of God's mysteries, or due to their personal worries, their hesitation prompted Jesus to ask one simple question: "How many loaves do you have?" (Mt. 15:34). Jesus directs the disciples’ attention away from their shortcomings, and helps them focus on what they already have. Although the answer to Jesus’ question was a mere seven loaves and a few small fish, Jesus still asked for the bread and fish to be collected so that they may give thanks to God. It is at this point, when the disciples surrender what little they think they have, that the Lord provides them with an overabundance in return.
Like the disciples, we might not be satisfied by what we think we have. If we exclude God from our challenges, we easily become overwhelmed. This leads to flawed knowledge of our capabilities and resources, and we ask questions full of doubt like “Who am I, that I should go and do this?” like Moses in Exodus 3:11. Our worries lead us to become selfish with our talents, as we hold back from completing God’s task out of fear of loss or embarrassment or failure.
When we surrender everything we have to God and act out of love and compassion for others, God gives us back everything in overabundance. He can multiply our blessings so that we may then spread His love to the community around us.
When meditating on this week’s readings, we should ask ourselves the same question posed by Jesus in verse 34. Be aware of what you have, rather than focusing on what you lack. Finally, whatever we have, we should submit to God, so that through His grace, our talents may be perfected in order to spread His love to all the people around us.
May God stop us from hindering ourselves with selfishness or worries, so that we may use our skills, resources, and blessings for His glory.
#### Questions for Meditation:
1. Do you belittle yourself or doubt your own abilities? When you find yourself worrying about failure or embarrassment, do you ever stop to think what God can do with even the smallest potential? Surrender everything to the Lord and stop hesitating.
2. Do you feel like your blessings are not multiplying? Consider reevaluating the motives for those talents. Are you using those skills or assets to share God’s love, or are you only seeking selfish gain?

St. Mark 3:20-30 - 7th Sunday after Pentecost
As we begin reading Chapter 3, we see more and more people beginning to wonder whether or not Christ truly is the “Son of David”. At this point in Christ’s life his popularity amongst the people was on the rise and wherever he went, the multitudes gathered, if for nothing else just to see what would happen next. Naturally, as is the case in today’s world there were people who were also not too fond of this popularity and sought to bring him down. [Enter the Pharisee’s].
The Pharisee’s saw this curiosity in Christ as a threat to their own power amongst the Jews, and had to come up with some sort of desperate explanation as to how Christ was able to perform his many works. These scribes were believed to be some of the most educated people of the time and the best reasoning they could offer up was that Jesus was doing all these things because “he has Beelzebub, by the ruler of the demons He casts out demons!”
It is my firm belief that Jesus Christ has an amazing sense of humor. My reason for saying so is because time and time again we see different people come to test and provoke Christ throughout the Scriptures and time and time again we see these vary same people walk away dismayed that their accusations got shot down. Mind you if someone had told you or I that the devil was working in us we would have flipped out and started fighting, but we see Christ use this desperate shot against him and he inserts this thing called “logic” into their accusation. In this ever famous rebuttal, Christ asks the Pharisee’s “How can Satan cast out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.”
For whatever reason the portion of this passage that stuck out to me the most was verse 25. A house divided against itself, cannot stand. If you take this statement in its most literal sense it gives you the basic blueprint to go out and build your very own home. It is understood that without a strong foundation it is very difficult to build a sturdy house that will withstand the wear and tear that houses encounter. This simple school of thought is also true when it comes to our lives as Christians.
We are now 7 weeks removed from celebrating the Feast of Pentecost, in which we see the Holy Spirit descend upon the Holy Church as well as each of us. Christ had referred to the Holy Spirit as our “helper”, a source of comfort that will be with us and furthermore IN us till the very end (John14:16-17). So now there you have it, you and I are walking temples of the living God because the Holy Spirit resides in us. If you take a second to let that sink in, you begin to realize that this means you and I have certain responsibilities, after all it takes a lot to make sure a house is in tip top shape!
As is the case with any house, we too have to face our fair share of battles with the “elements”. Being a young person growing up in this country, it is difficult being a temple of God. We frequently find ourselves in situations and trials where we shouldn’t be and although we have the Holy Spirit residing in us there are temptations to sin all around us; temptations, that go against the teachings of Christ and temptations that will ultimately harm our bodies (now all of the sudden our house has a few leaks in the roof).
Many of us have leaky roofs, the cause of each of our leaks might be a little different but we all have leaky roofs. It is at this critical moment where we have to analyze whether or not we are actually living the faith or merely going through the motions. We have to ask ourselves do our actions convey to others that God lives in us or do we simply just talk the talk while our actions do as they please. If we are in fact living the faith then we have to make sure we don’t end up in situations that cause us to sin. If we do in fact live the faith then we have to make sure we don’t hang out with the people that cause us to sin (if God isn’t attending that party on Saturday night then neither should you). True Christian life is one of struggle and sacrifice (Matt. 16:24). It was never meant to be easy and along the way we will encounter our fair share of rain, hail, and snow. The 2 worst things that we can possibly do for ourselves is to not find the cause of the leak and not to ask for help in order to fix the leak because if you let the leak grow the house will in fact surely not stand.
#### Questions for Meditation:
1. What are the “elements” in our lives that hinder us from being true houses of God? 
2. How do we utilize the “help” given to us to address these issues in our own lives (i.e. Clergy, Sacrament of Confession, etc)?

## Mysteries as Hard Teachings
### Published on Jul 18 2013 by Ciby Abraham, Philadelphia, ciby.abraham@gmail.com
John 6:47-59
I am glad that I was born into the Orthodox faith.  There was a time that I could not say this, especially in my youth when I thought I knew everything there was to know about God, the Bible and the Church.  I was very skeptical of the Church’s teachings, practices, and Biblical interpretations.  My biggest gripe was that the Church could not and would not give me some straight forward answers on some key issues.  Things like prayers for the departed, intercession with the saints and the Theotokos, and the Eucharist were explained not in clear cut terms but many times, as mysteries.  I couldn’t accept this.  Now, however, I believe it is the only faith that truly addresses the core needs and frailties of every person and that the Church preaches the fullness of Christ.
It’s hard to accept that some of the most important questions we have can’t be answered in clear yes/no terms.  This week’s gospel reading is a clear example of this.
Very truly I tell you, the one who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died. But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die. I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”
Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”
Jesus said to them, “Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.  For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them. Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.” He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. (John 6:47-59)
Reading this passage, we can see that the Jews had a hard time accepting the answers that Christ gave.  Christ said this soon after feeding the five thousand.  Those surrounding him were looking to have their bellies filled once more. Reading their hearts, Christ told them of the true bread which causes them to never hunger which is His body.  His answer not only confused but also repulsed them. Many turned away from him because they found it to be “a hard teaching”.
So how does one go about understanding this passage?  In Christian history, especially in the West, there were various theories to try and explain this passage, especially in very rationalistic terms.  Some tried to explain it as symbol; some explained it in true physical (“real”) transformation.  The Orthodox, however, simply says that it’s a mystery.  This was one of those answers that really turned me off when I was younger, but now it’s something I’ve grown to appreciate.
In our worldview, what is real and what is mystical are not mutually exclusive.  Our reality is only expressed in terms of how it manifests God to us.  This is why we say the Eucharist is the genuine body and blood of Christ, because these mysteries that Christ established bring to us the manifestation of God in Christ.  It can be very confusing to try and understand such things, but the simple explanation I use for myself is as follows:  God created us both with spirit and body, so we are both spiritual and physical beings. It’s easy to think of spiritual healing because it deals with what goes on in my mind and heart but what about my body?  If Christ is to sanctify me as a person, then my physical body must also be addressed.   So Christ must be present in the Eucharist, because if it’s just a symbol, then there’s really nothing truly addressing the needs of my physical being.  It’s not the most articulate of explanations, but it is sufficient for me.  It also truly brings to life the idea that Christ is in me and I in Him.
These concepts are not easily explained and in my opinion, they shouldn’t be.  Things such as beauty, art, music, and love could never be simply explained in simple mathematical formulas or scientific theories.  These truths have transcendent meanings that can’t be fully contained in words.  If this is true, how much less can God!
In my opinion, there is no other faith gives us the answers we truly seek and paradoxically leaves us in mystery.  I’m glad I’m an Orthodox Christian.

## The Human Lamp
In honor of the MGOCSM of North America's Philadelphia Leadership Camp, we would like to share the following homily of Very Rev. Fr. Vladimir Berzonsky of the Orthodox Church of America. His devotional is based upon the theme verse of this year's Leadership Camp: Matthew 5:16, "Let your light so shine before others, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven." Please remember this weekend's camp, its leaders, speakers and participants in your daily prayers. May God "ignite the fire" within us all!
### Published on Jul 25 2013 by Very Rev. Fr. Vladimir Berzonsky, Orthodox Church of America, Source: http://oca.org/reflections/berzonsky/the-human-lamp
“No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed, but sets it on a lamp stand, that those who enter may see the light” (Luke 8:16)
Our Lord’s words are clear: “Let your light so shine before others, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven” (Matthew5:16). The great saint Symeon the New Theologian added a vivid image that takes this idea even further on the way to spiritual understanding. He calls on us to imagine a lamp filled with oil, and in it a wick that is lit by the fuel from the oil.
Now as that lamp is burning in a room, casting its illumination throughout the space, suddenly a rat enters the room and leaps on the table where the lamp is lit. The rat knocks the lamp from the table, lapping up the oil and of course extinguishing the wick. The room is in total darkness.
Your soul is like that lamp holding the light of Christ, which you received after your baptism and Chrismation. The oil is the sum of the good things that you have done for God, for others and for yourself. That energy is keeping your soul illumined; but when your good deeds or virtues are poured out, you are running on empty. The wick is your mind. It is left without warm, kind thoughts or ideas that brighten your spirit. It’s dried out and worthless unless you again replenish your soul with virtues.
What can it be that will drain your goodness and replace it with sinful thoughts? Anger will do it, envy also—add to that the lustful passions that seize hold of your mind and force you to think of nothing else but sensual pleasures, so that you turn into an idolater and lose touch with your basic reasoning. Not just desires, but the yearning for revenge, the sadness that leads to despair, and the bitterness of wanting to be revenged on somebody who you feel did you an injury. Some of us will wallow in self-pity, blaming the Lord for allowing those sinful thoughts to enter our mind. That only makes it worse, because that person will not take ownership of his mental state. He will puff himself up with self-righteousness, as if he alone is without sin. Only he has the right to judge others, since nobody suffers as much as he.
On the other hand, when a person is filled with the light of Christ, he or she will do everything to keep that inner light and fire alive. The light serves a basic purpose by exposing what is dark, evil and corrupt. To follow Christ is to walk in the light that He casts around Him, so that His followers need never walk in darkness. When such a person is full of grace, living to serve God and others, striving to live a virtuous life, he will want to continue receiving those gifts from Christ.
Even more, the whole Holy Trinity is offering to give us a share in holiness. Yes, the Holy Spirit is within those who are pure, innocent and sincere in their faith. Can one say that the Holy Spirit is separate from the Lord Jesus, or that Christ is somewhere that the Father is not? It sounds bold and indeed, it is; nevertheless, we are invited to manifest the image of God and to become like Him in all ways except to share the essence of God head, which is exclusively for Father, Son and Holy Spirit. For those who arrive at that blessed state the Orthodox Church has a special term. They are called “those who are like” [God], in Slavonic prepodobni.

## Like a Child
### Published on Jul 31 2013 by Bessie Mathew, Philadelphia, Bessie.A.Mathew@gmail.com
Gospel of St. Matthew 18:1-11
“And he said: “Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.” Matthew 18:3
When I was younger I didn’t fully understand why Jesus told his disciples to change and become like children to enter the kingdom of heaven. It is only until I had a child of my own that I came to understand the reason behind it. Matthew Chapter 18:1 starts off with the disciples asking Jesus “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven”. Why do you think the disciples asked this question and what do you think was their intent?
When you read into it, you realize that they were focused on the organizational power and the stature of being a disciple and neglected to see their divine purpose. The disciples were blind to the Lord’s plan for them in His ministry and they forgot that the sole purpose of His coming was not for His earthly glorification but to humble Himself so that they may obtain the kingdom of heaven. How many times do we lose sight of what God intends for us and focus more on positions and honor within the Church? How can being like a child, change this thought or behavior?
Children completely rely and trust their parents. That is how we should be with Christ. Psalms 91 assures of that trust we should have with Christ. We should learn to completely trust that He will take care of all our needs. Children are also receptive, and humble. They want to know what everything is, means and feels. If we are completely humble, we should be open to what God is telling us. Because God is infinite, there is never too much that we can learn about Him. I guarantee that there will always be more. To be like a Child, we need to learn how to rejoice in good times and bad. It doesn’t take a whole lot for a baby to laugh; even the simplest of things make them happy. That is the kind of attitude that we need. We need to focus on the present time and the things that are good, like being a child of God.
Ever since my daughter Rebekah was young we have tried to teach her about the Lord, how much He has done for us and how we ought to be good disciples to Him. We didn’t realize how much she loved the Lord until she started talking and one of her first words was Jesus! When she was 3 she had learned more stories about Him and instantly fell in love with Him. Like David, she has a heart to follow him. It was that year that I witnessed what a role model she was to me. During a skit at Church that showed Jesus being crucified, Rebekah got very sad and started crying. It bothered her so much that we had to take her out and calm her down and tell her how even though Jesus went through the suffering, He raised up from the cross three days later and is with us today. Rebekah was not only happy but she was overjoyed with the news. How many of us are affected in that way by the sight of the cross? As I watched my little girl’s attitude change, I also saw the purity, joy, humility, and trust that we all should learn and possess from her. The reality is that even though she thinks that she is learning from me, it is really me learning from her.
Jesus is telling us to change, be transformed and be like a Child, to cling to Him and not the things of this world. He is teaching us that in order for us to ascend, we must be willing to descend and serve others and not be expecting to be served. Be humble in the sight of the Lord and He WILL lift you up.
#### Questions for Meditation:
1) What areas of your life do you tend to struggle with being like a child? 
2) In what ways are you making progress to be like a child?

## A Call to do His Work
### Published on Aug 08 2013 by Beena Korah, Midwest (St. Thomas Orthodox Church, Chicago), brkorah@gmail.com
St. Mark 6:7-13
It is that time of year again; where we hit the hard reality that summer break is almost over. In a few weeks we will be back to the routine of going to classes. Before we head back to our busy school lives, let’s take some time to reflect on St. Mark 6:7-13 and our mission in Christ.
St. Mark 6:7 says “And He called the twelve to Himself, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them power over unclean spirits.” There is a great importance to the word “called.” Jesus “calls” the disciples for His work. How do you know if you are called? We are all called by God to do His work. This work may be in our church, at school, or on a mission’s trip. God’s hand is upon you. No matter how much you try to avoid it, God will continue to call you until you answer that call. “Each and every believer has been given by the indwelling of the Spirit of God, gifts of the Spirit” (Acts 2:38). You must use those gifts given to you to fulfill His mission. Each one of us has a responsibility to pray and answer our Lord’s “call” to do His work.
In St. Mark 6:8 “He commanded them to take nothing for the journey except a staff-no bag, no bread, no copper in their money belts-but to wear sandals, and not to put on two tunics.” Today, most of us can’t even leave the house without our cell phones. We start to worry, if we forget our purses or wallets at home. We might interpret that Jesus wanted the disciples to experience, poverty or survival. On the other hand, Jesus might have had something deeper in mind. If the disciples were to leave with out anything in hand, they would have to go to these places and experience hospitality first hand. How can one do mission’s work without knowing how to be hospitable? Hospitality is the first step in doing mission’s work. The first place you can learn hospitality is within your home. There are many times when we go to someone else’s house, and the people are too busy on their phones or computers to even come and talk to us. When someone comes to your house, where are you? Are you on your phone, playing a game or texting? Do you come and greet, serve, and spend time with your visitors? If you cannot show hospitality to your neighbors, how can you do the mission of Christ?
In St. Mark 6:11 Jesus says, “And whoeverwill not receive you nor hear you, when you depart from there, shake off the dust under your feet as a testimony against them.” At first, this may seem really aggressive, but in reality it is a call to keep going. Jesus is letting the disciples know that there will be many times when there are disappointments in our journey. Instead of dwelling in that disappointment, we need to shake the dust from under our feet and try again.  Often in our missions, when we come upon someone who is not willing to receive us or hear us, we get angry. Instead, we need to continue offering the gift of love. How many times have you tried to do something at church and not too many people show up? All of us have experienced our share of failures and disappointments in one way or another, but that should not stop us. We should keep moving forward and continue to do His work.
As we are preparing to end our summers and go back to school keep in mind God’s call and mission for you. Work on your hospitality no matter where you are and prepare yourself for God’s call and mission. Finally, never give up. There will be many situations where things don’t go the way you expected, but keep moving forward with the strength of the Lord.
#### Questions for Meditation:
1) How can you use your gifts of the Spirit to answer His call and do His work?
2) How can you shake off the dust from under your feet? Think of an example from your own life.

## Treasures of the Heart
### Published on Aug 21 2013 by Rachel Pyngolil, Florida, rachel.pyngolil@gmail.com
St. Luke 6:39-45
Luke 6:39-45 – “Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?”
What is it that blinds us to our own faults but makes us so attuned to the flaws of others? The answer to this question is quite personal and varies among individuals but shares some common elements that are well-illustrated in this simple fable:
A WOLF, passing by, saw some Shepherds in a hut eating a haunch of mutton for their dinner.  Approaching them, he said, "What a clamor you would raise if I were to do as you are doing!" (Aesop's Fables)
Why is the shepherd allowed to eat the sheep, and the wolf shunned from partaking of the same meal? Would we not describe this as hypocrisy? A part of our hypocrisy comes from the fact that we permit ourselves certain habits and characteristics that we criticize in others. We tell ourselves, we can do these things/be this way because we are who we are, and they cannot because of who they are. Have you ever given advice has the following tone:
 “I would not recommend that you do [whatever activity/behavior/decision]… I only do [whatever activity/behavior/decision] because I am… older? wiser? more accomplished? I have seen the world? I live rightly in many other ways? I have been through certain experiences?”
I am sure I have, and when I reflect back to those situations, I find the advice completely “justifiable” and “contextually appropriate.” However, this passage cautions us that if our lives do not reflect our own teachings and advice, we will be as the “blind leading the blind.” If we live in darkness, ignorance - blinded to our own hidden faults, we will be completely incapable of leading ourselves much less others who are struggling in the way of life. St Cyril of Alexandria goes so far as to say that “it is not possible for those enveloped in the darkness of ignorance to guide those who are afflicted in the same way into the knowledge of the truth” because “should they attempt it, they will both roll into the ditch of carelessness.”
Carelessness is not a quality any of us would ascribe to our Christian lives. If anything, we would say, we care too much! We are careful about how we live our lives, the examples we set, the fruits of our efforts for His Kingdom because we consider it the product of our faith. We worry ourselves with the external manifestation of our faith and even extend this to others by sharing our experiences and advice to help them lead a life that models Christian character. Yet He does not ask us to concern ourselves with these actions, or these deeds or the fruits of our labors alone; He reminds us that we should care for the tree, itself. Are we leading a life that is rooted in Christ? Do we tend daily to our hearts, pruning away its vices? Have we opened our eyes to the matters or sins we have concealed deep within ourselves?
The essence of this passage is beautifully conveyed in the words of St Bede: “If anyone who calls upon the name of the Lord resists the Lord’s commands by living perversely, it is evident that the good that the tongue has spoken has not been brought out of the good treasures in his heart. It was not the root of a fig tree but that of a thorn bush that produced the fruit of such a confession – a conscience that is bristling with vices, and not filled with the sweetness of the love of the Lord.” (Bede, Homilies on the Gospels). There is much good that we do in our daily lives – giving to the poor, serving others, leading a pious life, but if these actions come from mere habit or obligation, they lack the quality of deeds done out of our “love of the Lord”. This passage calls us to examine our lives and our hearts through the eyes of God. “Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but the Lord weighs the heart." (Proverbs 21:2). In our continued journey, may our lives overflow with the abundance of our love for Him.
#### Questions for Meditation: 
1. “Every way of a man is right in his own eyes…” What are some thoughts, feelings, or biases I have about myself and my heart? How does this affect the way in which I perceive others?
2. Is there an instance where my words or actions may have hurt someone? What hidden faults of my heart were uncovered in that instance? How has this affected my relationship with that person? With God?

## Seek N' Find
### Published on Aug 29 2013 by Anita John, Philadelphia (Northeast Diocese), 215-908-5346, anitajohn87@gmail.com
“So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. If a son asks for bread from any father among you, will he give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent instead of a fish? Or if he asks for an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!"
And He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. So it was, when the demon had gone out, that the mute spoke; and the multitudes marveled. But some of them said, “He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.” Others, testing Him, sought from Him a sign from heaven. But He, knowing their thoughts, said to them: “Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and a house divided against a house falls. If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? Because you say I cast out demons by Beelzebub. And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. But if I cast out demons with the finger of God, surely the kingdom of God has comeupon you.”
“For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.” (Luke 11:10). It so seems easy right? So why do we all fail to do such simple tasks. We get so tied up in the struggles of our daily lives that sometimes we seek elsewhere for answers and forget to realize that our Heavenly Father is waiting to give us His gifts and guidance in everything we do. However, in order to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, we must earnestly and persistently ask for the Holy Spirit through prayer and repentance. Throughout our lives, we seek for materialistic things that we think will help us grow but what we fail to realize is that the most important gift we can earnestly seek and ask for is the renewal, guidance, wisdom and strength of the Holy Spirit, who will guide us in our growth and walk with Christ. As baptized Orthodox Christians, we have all received the Holy Spirit in the sacrament of Baptism. (I Cor. 2:12)
Ever since we were born, our parents have unconditionally given us what we have needed to flourish and grow in this world. Though our parents do so much for us, often times we end up hurting them through our behaviors and words, but through their discipline, their love continues to grow. Even deeper is God’s love and concern for us. “If you then, being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!” (Luke 11:13) Can you imagine how great the gift of the Holy Spirit can be within us! It is just mind-blowing to think how great and loving our Heavenly Father is!
The parable of the Prodigal Son is an example of this love. Like the younger son, we say and do things that cause us to stray away from the love of God. We have all fallen for the worldly desires and the devil’s tricks. We typically feel guilt afterwards which then leads to anger in our hearts. In our struggles, we often feel abandoned, alone and overcome by feelings of unworthiness, but then in a moment of clarity, like the prodigal son, we’re reminded of God’s goodness, and through a repentant heart, we earnestly seek God’s mercy and forgiveness. Like the prodigal son, we must also be able to compassionately repent to our Father saying, “I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son, make me like one of your hired servants.” (Luke 15: 19). It is humbling to know God is there to receive us, just like He received the prodigal son, regardless of how much we feel we have drifted from Him. We should then continue to work on our relationship with God through prayer. Prayer should be in our heart, mind and soul. It should be the foundation of our lives. Just as a house bears a foundation, our spiritual lives should be standing on the foundation of prayer.
In the coming week or so, we will be getting ready to wrap up the summer and begin a new academic year, which may bring a tinge of excitement or dreadfulness in us, but it should also be an opportunity for us to continue to grow in our relationship with Christ.  As we try to grow closer to Christ, we may also feel that the devil draws nearer to us. It may be a daily struggle to keep a healthy balance in our spiritual walk with Christ but God’s love for us should compel us to grow closer to Him, seeking and asking for His Spirit to nurture and guide us. As the year progresses we may be faced with struggles, both academically and personally, there will be times that we may feel helpless and hopeless. However, always remember to “Pray without ceasing” (I Thessalonians 5:17). Prayer can be a source of comfort for us. It should be through prayer that we earnestly ask and seek for the Holy Spirit to protect us from the many “demons” that may fight with us as we work to grow closer to Christ.
#### Questions for Meditation:
1) How often do we try to make something happen in our lives without asking God for help?
2) How often do we try to handle our own problems without seeking for God’s guidance?

## Pay Your Taxes
### Published on Sep 06 2013 by Ajith Joy, Dallas-Oklahoma, ajithen09@yahoo.com
When they had come to Capernaum, those who received the temple tax came to Peter and said, “Does your Teacher not pay the temple tax?” He said, “Yes.” And when he had come into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes, from their sons or from strangers?” Peter said to Him, “From strangers.” Jesus said to him, “Then the sons are free. Nevertheless, lest we offend them, go to the sea, cast in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first. And when you have opened its mouth, you will find a piece of money; take that and give it to them for Me and you.” - Gospel of St. Matthew 17:22-27
We, humans, could never understand why there are rules for us to follow, because we don’t like to follow them. When I think about rules to follow, I have often thought why follow earthly rules when I could follow God’s rules. I am sure many of us have thought this way and wondered which rule is better and which one to follow. Often times, regardless of age, we find it difficult to obey rules. When rules really bother us is when we get stopped by a police officer on the road and get a ticket. After putting some thought it my own understanding of finding the difference between God’s rules and earthly rules I realized that they are both meant to be followed. First I had to find out what is the temple tax, which I found out to be annual head tax on all male Jews (except the priest) over twelve years of age for the maintenance of the temple. Well then why did Jesus pay the temple tax?
Jesus, the Son of God, pays the temple tax created from humans on earth. This did not make any sense to me, because He is above everyone including the priest. If you look closer you will find out that Jesus pays the temple tax to avoid conflict with the leaders and to show everyone that He is just like everyone else. This is where Jesus shows us that rules on earth are meant to followed, because if we argue the rules then we are creating a conflict. Jesus taught us that if someone slaps one of your cheeks then show him the other one also. From all this we should understand that we should just follow rules to not create a conflict but spread God’s peace throughout the world. The second point Christ shows us here is that He humbles himself to mankind’s level and pays the temple tax. Jesus being the highest of any high priest didn’t have to pay the tax but He does anyways. After reading these verses is when I really understood which rules to follow, because Jesus shows us the importance of following every rule to be respectful and keep the earthly peace.
As we struggle our way through college, school, or even work, we should really consider the importance of learning to follow. We are taught to lead and sometimes we forget to follow. As we are coming up on the Feast of the Holy Cross, we should lower ourselves as Christ (being greater than any priest) humbled himself and paid the temple tax. I pray that God almighty will give me and you the willpower to humble ourselves and follow Him.
#### Questions for Meditation:
1. Why do you think Jesus made peter go to the sea and make him get money from the fish? What is the importance of the fish? 
2. Who is referred as the sons and the strangers here?

## The Lights of an Approaching Rescue
### Published on Sep 11 2013 by Fr. Lawrence Farley, St. Herman of Alaska Orthodox Church; Langley, B.C., Canada (Orthodox Church of America)
Gospel of St. Matthew 5:38-48
The Nativity of the Theotokos
This past Sunday, September 8, we celebrated the Great Feast of the Nativity of the Theotokos. We sang the troparion, in which we rejoiced that her birth “proclaimed joy to the whole universe.” It is easy enough to sing, but somewhat harder now for us to understand. Why, we may ask, did the birth of a baby girl in around 15 B.C. or so proclaim joy to the whole inhabited world?
To fully understand what this birth meant, we must first understand the state of the world at that time. The world into which Mary the future Mother of the Savior was born was a doomed world. The average person would live a short life (compared to today’s expected life span), a life filled with pain, poverty, and unceasing labor. In Israel he would find himself oppressed by crushing taxation, vexed by foreign occupation, and troubled by suffering and disease. (If this seems too pessimistic an evaluation, take some time to consider what it would be like to live in a world without anaesthetics.) Life would be punctuated periodically with times of joy, such as the day of marriage, the birth of children, and times of pilgrimage and sacrifice in the Temple, but would end all too soon in sickness and death. Little surprise that Zechariah the father of John the Baptist described it as “sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death” (Lk. 1:79). To get some idea of what it felt like, think of the people who survived the sinking of the R.M.S. Titanic: after that fabled ship sank without a trace at 2.20 a.m. on April 14, 1912, 705 people sat in lifeboats in the dark in the middle of the ice-cold Atlantic, waiting for rescue, unsure if it would come in time. Two hours later, when they saw the approaching lights of rescue from the R.M.S. Carpathia, they were glad indeed. In the words of our festal hymn, the lights of that ship “proclaimed joy” for them. The birth of the baby girl chosen by God to be the Theotokos similarly proclaimed joy for the whole world, for it also meant that within a few short years, rescue would be at hand. An angel of God would soon enough appear to Mary and she would give birth to the Messiah, who would end our long captivity and bring light and eternal life to the whole universe.
In the Mother of God, we find the whole sacred history of Israel reaching its goal, for Israel’s long history had no other purpose than the Incarnation of God. When God called Abraham out of Mesopotamia to sojourn in Palestine, the goal was the Incarnation. When God raised up the Patriarchs Isaac and Jacob and the twelve children of Israel, the goal was the Incarnation. When God caused them to sojourn in Egypt and there become a mighty nation, the goal was the Incarnation. When God brought Israel out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, the goal was the Incarnation. When God gave Israel the Land of Palestine and raised up judges and kings for them there, the goal was the Incarnation. All of God’s long and painful striving with His covenant people had as its one and supreme goal the Incarnation, made possible through the free and courageous assent of a pious Jewish teen-ager from Nazareth, a young woman who offered her heart, her life, and her flesh to God, saying, “Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord. Let it be to me according to your word.” It was through that assent, by the Holy Spirit, that the timeless One entered time, and the One who filled heaven and earth became a fetus in a tiny human womb. Through Him our long captivated would be ended.
At this feast we read the Lord’s words which say that blessing from God comes not through biology alone, but from hearing the Word of God and keeping it (Lk. 11:28). It was this Word which was addressed to Israel, and which they too often ignored. It was this Word which was addressed to Mary and which she fully heeded and kept. What is this Word? It is the call to look away from this present life and to find meaning and life in the Kingdom of God. It is the Word which calls us away from mediocrity to follow the Lord in the adventure of faith, to cease being mere children of the body and to become the children of the Kingdom. This Word called Israel away from being a mere nation to become the Church; it called Mary away from the security of normal motherhood to become a disciple of her Son, even if it meant that a sword would pierce her heart. It calls us all from being ordinary people to being extraordinary, wrapping our lives around Jesus as Mary did, and following Him along the way of the cross to our final glory. That was Israel’s true destiny and destination. It was a destiny and destination fulfilled by Mary of Nazareth as she became the Theotokos and the Mother of our God. On September 8 we celebrate her faithfulness to that destiny. Once we sat in darkness and the shadow of death, but then we saw the approaching lights of rescue as a little girl was born to Joachim and Anna. Her birth proclaimed our coming rescue, and our eternal joy.

## Second Coming of Christ
### Published on Sep 18 2013 by Rev. Fr. Paulose T. Peter, New York
Gospel of St. Mark 13:28-37
First Sunday after the Feast of the Holy Cross
"No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be on guard! Be alert! You do not know when that time will come.” Mark 13:32-33.
The gist of this Sunday’s reading is the Second Coming of Christ or parousia which is a Greek term meaning ‘arrival’ or ‘coming.’ Though the common usage is ‘second coming,’ the phrase is missing in the New Testament. The word ‘second’ is omitted in the New Testament except by way of reference as seen in Hebrews 9:28. The idea of the Second Coming of Christ in Mark is also echoed in Matthew 24:36-51. One can identify about a hundred or so references pointing to the Second Coming of Christ in the Bible. Those references tell us the manner of His coming and how we should be prepared to receive Him rather than give us a time table for His arrival.
Jesus’ Second Coming is one of the foundations of Orthodox Christian spirituality. In Matthew’s version, Jesus will come again but “No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” (Matt. 24:36) The key words used by Mark in this Sunday’s reading are “Be on guard! Be alert!” and “keep watch.”
Unpredictability is the underlying theme here. We all agree that there is unpredictability in our lives. No matter how careful we are, things do happen without warning that change our lives upside down. We know that we are helpless when things get out of control. Yet, we also know that proper precautions and preparations will better equip us in unanticipated situations. The very fact that our lives are subject to change without notice calls us to be alert and watchful so that we are not caught unprepared. The same idea is projected by Matthew and Mark in our preparedness to receive Christ at His Second Coming. The life of Moses is a classic example to our own everyday lives.
Moses enjoyed all the comfort and luxury as a prince in the royal court of Egypt for the first forty years of his life. He was young and he had education, power and wealth (Acts 7:22-23). The fact that the rest of his life would be so radically different is hard to imagine. He spent the next 40 years of his life as a shepherd and herdsman (Acts 7:29-30). Moses probably thought at the age of eighty that he would live out his days as a shepherd but God had other plans for him. From the day he saw a burning bush on Mount Sinai, he went on to live another 40 years as a prophet, a law-giver, and a leader of a nation. Truly, he lived three lives in one lifetime, and even his last days were not exactly the way he had planned (Deut.3:27).
Moses’ life teaches us that we must not be too quick to pronounce our lives as settled or done. Our lives may change at any time and the Lord may require from us things that we never anticipated. As Moses’ life illustrates, if the unpredictability in our lives force us to be cautious and prepared in our daily lives, how much more should we be on our guard and be alert for the Second Coming of Christ?
"No one knows about that day or hour”. God has His own time schedule. If Jesus was there on time her brother would not have died, complained the sister of Lazarus. We get frustrated when we do not get what we want when we want it. We are like the little boy who prayed ‘Lord, give me patience and I want it right now.’
Look at Moses’ life again. When he was a young man he killed an Egyptian and that was the right time for the Lord to use him to deliver Israel (Acts7:23-25). He was bold and confident in the strength of his youth, and he was ready to take on the challenge. But that was not God's plan, and Moses had to flee to save his life. Years later, God called upon him to deliver Israel when he was old and weak. (Ex. 3:9-10) But by that time Moses was unwilling to take on that challenge.
We sometimes look at the way things unfold in our life, and we wonder if God knows what He is doing. Make no mistake; God knows what He is doing. In Moses’ case God accomplished His purpose using an 80 year old man. God, through Moses, proved to the world that it is His power that delivers and not that of the person he uses. God has his own exquisite timing. In our everyday lives, if things do not work according to our time table, how much more we be alert and on our guard to await the Second Coming of Christ of which no one knows the day or the hour except the Father?
Those who are on their guard keeping watch and be prepared for the Second Coming of Christ place their hope on the promise of God for a better life when our earthly life is over. Moses, during his earthly life, could not exactly fulfill all his wishes. He led the Israelites into the Promised Land but he himself was forbidden to enter. Though he could not enter the Promised Land in his life time he certainly did after his death. He appeared with Elijah at the transfiguration of Jesus on Mount Tabor in the Promised Land many years after his death.
St. Matthew makes a beautiful comparison of the coming of the Son of Man to what happened in the days of Noah (Matt. 24:37). As there was but one ark in the days of Noah, there is but one way of salvation. The whole world was drowned under the flood of God’s wrath, except for those few souls who prepared themselves to go into the ark even when others made fun of them. Even so, the whole world shall be destroyed in the everlasting wrath of almighty God, except those blessed men and women who lead a life pleasing to God and be on their guard keeping watch to receive Jesus Christ at his Second Coming because "There is no other name under heaven, given among men, whereby we must be saved."

## In Him, Through Him and For Him
### Published on Sep 26 2013 by Nishant Zachariah, Atlanta, GA, nishant@gatech.edu
Gospel of St. Matthew 16:5-12
Second Sunday after the Feast of the Holy Cross
“When they went across the lake, the disciples forgot to take bread. “Be careful,” Jesus said to them. “Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” They discussed this among themselves and said, “It is because we didn’t bring any bread.” Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, “You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread? Do you still not understand? Don’t you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? How is it you don’t understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees” 
#### In Him:
They discussed this among themselves and said, “It is because we didn’t bring any bread.” Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, “You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?
We are unequivocally creatures of habit. From the never ending bustle of the morning hours to the late nights induced by work/school, we are buffeted by the world that we live in. It surrounds us, permeates our very being and thus irrevocably fogs our perception of the eternal. Two thousand years ago, when Christ walked among us, humanity was as it is today. We remained rooted in wanton needs of our circumstances. The disciples struggled with this constantly as they went through their spiritual transformation.
In this specific passage, while our Savior Jesus Christ was alluding to the teaching (yeast) of the Pharisees and Sadducees, the disciples viewed the similitude through the lens of materialism. The disciples having forgotten to take bread with them when they left on their journey across the lake, were preoccupied about their immediate worldly needs. Scripture is filled with promises about the Lord’s providence in our lives and exhortation against anxiety despite the monstrosity of insurmountable circumstances that might be facing our lives.
#### Scriptural Hope:
Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? (Matthew 6:26)
#### Scriptural Exhortation:
Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God (Philippians 4:6)
#### Scriptural Promise:
No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it (1 Corinthians 10:13)
Only In Him are we able to overcome the world to focus our spiritual eyes towards the cross that frees us from the bondage of sin.
#### Through Him:
Do you still not understand?... How is it you don’t understand that I was not talking to you about bread?
Our savior’s admonishment to the disciples resonates through time and strikes a chord in every Christian’s heart to this day. Spiritual discernment in the form of understanding scripture or discerning the Lord’s will for our lives is rooted in Christ. In short, spiritual discernment is a gift from the Lord.
#### Spiritual Hope:
I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better. (Ephesians 1:17)
#### Spiritual Exhortation:
At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do. All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. (Luke 10:21-22)
#### Scriptural Promise:
But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you. (John 14:26)
It is only through Him that we move from spiritual blindness to clairvoyant discernment of His will for our lives. While the Lord’s will for each of our lives might vary, each and every one of us of us are called to be ambassadors for the faith. The mantle of reflecting Christ in everything that we do, rests squarely on our shoulders.
#### For Him:
But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees
The analogy that our savior Jesus Christ used to describe false teaching could not be more apt. Yeast by design causes fermentation over time. During the time of Christ, bread was made by incorporating old dough into a new batch. The premise was that the remnant yeast would over time ferment the new dough over time. In the same way, even small tiny sins which are not placed before our Lord with a repentant heart will grow and fester over time alienating us from our Lord.
#### Spiritual Hope:
Get rid of the old yeast, so that you may be a new unleavened batch--as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. (1 Corinthians 5:7)
#### Spiritual Exhortation:
Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary the devil walketh about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour (1 Peter 5:8) 
#### Spiritual Promise:
He told them still another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough." (Matthew 13:33)
As Christians’ all that we do is For Him and for His glory. It is our steadfast rampart against the winnows of the world. 
#### Questions for Meditation:
1) Have you made spiritual discernment a prayer item for your life?
2) What is the yeast in your life that you need to place before our Savior’s throne of grace?

## Sabbath and our Responsibilities
### Published on Oct 05 2013 by Anu Peter, New York, avt1012@hotmail.com
Gospel of St. Mark 2: 23-28
Third Sunday after the Feast of the Holy Cross
“Now it happened that He went through the grainfields on the Sabbath; and as they went His disciples began to pluck the heads of grain. And the Pharisees said to Him, “Look, why do they do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?” But He said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and those with him: how he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and also gave some to those who were with him?” And He said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath. Therefore the Son of Man is also the Lord of the Sabbath.”
Exodus 16:23 says, “This is what the Lord commanded: ‘Tomorrow is to be a day of Sabbath rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.’” The Sabbath refers to us resting from our daily duties and dedicating the day to the Lord. We cannot use the Sabbath as an excuse not to do any work. We have to spend the day with our Lord, and thank Him for all that He has blessed us with. We have certain expectations that are required of us, and before we take rest in the Lord’s Sabbath, we have to make sure we complete our tasks and jobs. We cannot take ‘the Sabbath’ in a literal sense. We can only take rest after we do all that God wants us to accomplish. We cannot be like the Pharisees and Sadducees, who took the meaning of the Sabbath in a literal sense.
The Pharisees and Sadducees always questioned Jesus. They tried to see if He would say anything wrong. During the time of Christ, the Pharisees and Sadducees were high on the political and social ladder. Pharisees and Sadducees did not have an interest in helping people. We have to be careful of the acts and deeds of the Pharisees and Sadducees. They represent people that praise God with their mouths, but turn their heads away from God. The Gospel of St. Matthew 7:21 says, “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,” will enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in Heaven.” We cannot be like them, we cannot be hypocrites, who say one thing and then end up doing something else. We want to praise God with our mouths, and also turn our hearts toward God. We cannot only be people that praise God with our mouths, but we also have to praise God with our actions and deeds. Our faith should be rooted in our deeds. St. James 2:17 says, “So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.” The people that we come into contact with on a daily basis, and the people who are around us should see what we do, and follow our actions in worshipping God.
We should always avoid procrastination at all costs. Whatever we can do now, we should finish because we do not know if we are going to get a chance to do the task tomorrow. God is the only one who knows what is going to happen in the next second. We, as God’s children, have an abundant amount of responsibilities to accomplish here on this Earth. However, in everything that we do, we should never forget God, and we should never think that we can do anything on our own. Everything that we do is due to the power and strength of the Almighty God.
#### Questions for Meditation:
1) What does the commandment “keep holy the Sabbath” require of us?
2) What are our responsibilities as a Christian?
3) “The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.” What does this mean to you?

## Heart Battles
### Published on Oct 17 2013 by Subin Oommen, Chicago, IL, 847.687.0751, Subin.Oommen@gmail.com
St. Matthew 23:1-12
“I the Lord search the heart and examine the mind, to reward each person according to their conduct, according to what their deeds deserve.” –Jeremiah 17:10
As we look closer at this week’s Gospel reading which was taken from St. Matthew 23:1-12, we must understand the context of the scripture reading.  Here Jesus is speaking directly and very bluntly to the Pharisees.  The Pharisees were religious leaders that held a great deal of influence among the Jewish people of Jesus’ day.  Because of their great influence the Pharisees were often seen with high regard by the general public.  Not all of the teachings of the Pharisees were bad, but it was their lifestyle that is being called out to the forefront by Jesus.
“Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues” (Mathew 23:5-6).  Phylacteries were little leather boxes that contained scripture verses.  These boxes were traditionally worn by Jewish men to obey Old Testament teachings (Deuteronomy 6:8, Exodus 3:9).  These became an outer display of their status as “religious men”, and our Lord calls out the characteristics that have led them astray from what scripture teaches.  They live not according to the truths they preach, undeservingly sought respect, and high titles. The Pharisees often wore something to distinguish that they were religious leaders, but what’s important here is that others should know our faith not by what we wear but where our hearts are pointing.  “The Lord does not look at things man looks at.  Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart” (1 Samuel 16:7).
You may be wondering how is this applicable to us?  What Jesus is attacking are not the Pharisees as a whole but rather the attitudes of their mind.  These attitudes can be found just as easily within the Christian community of that time and every period since then.  Just like the Pharisees, we all have great influence on those that surround us daily especially as Christians.  Whether this is in the classroom, college campuses, or in our own homes, we have to find ways to be living out our faith and not just by words alone.  “And whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.” (Matthew 23:12) Like Jesus who came down to earth as a man and willing humbled himself to a death on the cross, we have to strive and be willing to become a servant of all and not be bound by our pride or laziness.
At the end of the day, God is not so much interested solely on our words but where our hearts are at.  Our God is a loving God who is seeking sincerity and honesty from us rather than being “spiritually correct” with him by an outward display of affection.  The temptation lurks around us to constantly pretend with the Lord, but it does us no good as the Lord knows our hearts and our minds. Our lives have to be a testament of Christ’s teachings, and if our lives are not in accordance with His teachings, you and I are no different than the Pharisee’s Jesus is talking to in Mathew 23:1-12.
#### Questions to reflect on:
1) Think about the constant relationship God has with you, and identify areas in your life where you are not letting him in or ignoring him.
2) Dig into Matthew 23:1-12. What emotion do you think Jesus expressed when saying these things? What things were the Pharisees doing that pointed to their lack of sincerity? What remedy does Jesus leave them with in verses 11-12? 
3) Who is one person in your life that demonstrates sincerity?  How would you describe their  character?  How does it make you feel when someone is less than sincere with you?

## Three Steps to Everlasting Life
### Published on Oct 24 2013 by Fr. Vladimir Berzonsky
“For as Jonah was for three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth” (Matthew 12:40).
On the fourth Sunday of the Great Lent the Holy Church honors the memory of St. John called Climacus, which means “The Ladder.” He’s called that because of the astounding book he wrote dedicated to helping those serious about salvation to progress on the way to God’s Kingdom. He lived not far from Mt. Sinai, where Moses received the Ten Commandments. He divided his book into thirty chapters in honor of the hidden years that our Lord Jesus Christ spent on earth. Each chapter is a stage, or rung, on the ascent to Heaven. He wrote it for monks, yet thousands of lay persons have been helped and edified by applying its lessons to themselves. The themes include spiritual and physical seclusion, or at least separating ourselves from the society around us; obedience to God’s will; self-discipline; discernment, meaning evaluating everything in life and perceiving what will do us good and what is harmful; purity of life; and prayer.
In chapter 26:158 the saint refers to the story of Jonah who fell overboard from a ship and was swallowed by a great fish, usually thought to be a whale. When Jesus was being asked for some miracle or sign of His authority, our Lord told the Pharisees who asked for a sign that only the sinful and adulterous need a sign to supplement their faith. The only sign that God will provide will be for He Himself to die, to be buried and to be resurrected after three days to life everlasting.
St. John explained that it would be enough for a human being to spend three hours, or three periods of time in overcoming three different impediments to salvation. They are:
A. Ambition, or the love of glory. How sad to see this sin dominate many, even among the leaders of the Church, those ordained to set an example of humility and selflessness, who strut about seeking praise and honors. “They love the place of honor at banquets…they love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have men call them ‘Rabbi.’ But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have only one Master and you are all brothers” (Matthew 23:7). “For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted” (Matthew 23:12).
B. Sensuality, or the love of pleasure. We Americans take for granted that we have the right to enjoy life in all ways and varieties. It’s not just envy, but loathing that many people in the world have for us. Our image is that of shameless hedonists. Many people of culture and taste see us as self-indulgent pleasure-seekers bent on wallowing in all forms of opulence and extravagance. Obviously not all Americans are like that. Certainly true Christians may never be among them.
C. Love of money. It pains me to hear of the boasting even from my fellow Orthodox of their wealth, as though that were to their spiritual credit. I realize that our nation is essentially capitalist. Money is an obsession with so many fellow citizens. For a serious Christian this is an impediment to salvation. Jesus felt pity for those who worshipped money, and He said so many times in His preaching: “I tell you it is easier for a camel to pass through a needle, than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God” (Matthew 19:24).
This then is the challenge set before us. A struggle for our souls continues to engage us. Do we offer ourselves heart, soul, mind and body to the God who created us and claims us for Himself, or do we surrender to the devil?

## God's Purpose For Us
### Published on Oct 30 2013 by Subdeacon Alexander (Pradeep) Hatcher, Northwest U.S./Western Canada, 509.768.2241, peradinho@hotmail.com
St. Matthew 5:21-26
You have heard that it was said to your ancestors, 'You shall not kill; and whoever kills will be liable to judgment.'  But I say to you, whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment...(Mt 5:21-22a, NAB)
These two verses from the Gospel of St. Matthew reveal God's will for us so simply, yet with such infinite depth.  I once heard a parishioner ask a bishop of the Coptic Orthodox Church why the Old Testament, with all its commandments and strict laws, was more difficult to follow than the New Testament.  The bishop replied with this verse in mind, saying "In the Old Covenant you are guilty if you kill someone.  In the New Covenant, you are guilty for even having hate in your heart.  You tell me which is more difficult to follow."
Christ did not come to abolish the Old Testament, but to fulfill it (Mt 5:17).  Our Lord fulfills the Old Covenant not only by shedding His blood, but He fulfills the Law and the Prophets by opening our eyes to the fullness of the Holy Scriptures.  It is Christ who interprets the Scriptures for us.  Without him, our eyes are 'veiled' to the true intent of God's law (II Cor 3:12-16).  Without Christ, we have no light by which to read Scripture.
Christ brought us to the true understanding of God's law as parents wean children off milk and introduce them to solid foods (I Cor 3:1-2).  In our brokenness as spiritual 'infants,' we could not see God's true purpose for us - the purpose behind his commandments and laws.  In His mercy, the Father revealed this purpose to us fully through his only Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.  He walked among us to show this to us through His teachings and his very life.  God's purpose for us is this: to love.  Without being loving creatures, we cannot hope to return to Him who is love (I John 4:7-8).
Love is also essential because God does not desire that we return to him alone.  God desires we return to him together (I Tim 2:4).  Without unity with each other, there can be no unity, or communion, with God.  Recall what Adam said of Eve: "bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh" (Gen 2:23).  Though we as individuals are separate, God created human beings with such a profound link with one another that our past, present, and future are intrinsically linked.  When one person sins, all of creation is affected, regardless of innocence or guilt (Rom 5:12-21).  When one person suffers, all of humanity suffers.  The Desert Father St. Anthony the Great said with great insight, "Our life and death are with our neighbor.  If we gain our brother we have gained God, but if we scandalize our brother, we have sinned against Christ."
This unity among human beings is so important that the Divine Liturgy itself - which offers us a brief taste of eternal life with God - requires it.  Matthew 5: 23-24 teaches:
Therefore, if you bring your gift to the altar, and there recall that your brother has anything against you, leave your gift there at the altar, go first and be reconciled with your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
This is why the Holy Eucharist cannot proceed without the Kiss of Peace.  Without forgiveness and reconciliation with each other, there can be no reconciliation with God.  Communion with each other is required for communion with God.  Lord have mercy on us, who far too often offer each other the Kiss of Peace every Sunday without meaning it with all our heart.
Christ teaches us in Mt. 5: 21-26, then, it is not enough simply not to harm another person.  We must also love them unconditionally. There can be no place for hate in the heart of a follower of Christ.  St. Isaac the Syrian says of a compassionate heart:
It is a heart on fire for the whole of creation, for humanity, for the birds, for the animals, for demons and for all that exists...as a result of his deep mercy his heart shrinks and cannot bear to hear or look on any injury or the slightest suffering of anything in creation.  This is why he constantly offers up prayer full of tears, even for the irrational animals and for the enemies of truth, even for those who harm him, so that they may be protected and find mercy.
Let your heart be full of love and empty all hate from it.  Only then will your heart be opened for Christ to enter.
#### Questions for Meditation:
1) When you pray for someone you "hate" or are having difficulty with, how sincere are you when praying for them?
2) Do you merely mention them in passing, or do you pray for them by name and with full concentration?
3) When you pray for someone earnestly and sincerely wish good things for them, you cannot help but begin to love them, no matter how much you may have "hated" them before.

## Christ, the True Foundation

Feast of the Sanctification of the Church
Gospel of St. Matthew 16:13-23
Sanctification of the Church was a foreign phrase to me growing up in the Church. Rarely would I hear anything like that. Everything was always in Malayalam or what I thought was Malayalam. Later in life I began to recognize another language. It is not common to hear the significance of ‘sanctification of the church’ or terms such as ‘Koodosh Eetho’ discussed in our churches. We may end up not listening because we do not understand and the terms get lost in translation.
In our Gospel portion, Christ is trying to find out what He means to His disciples. After the disciples had been with Christ through thick and thin, Christ is curious, do they really get it? Christ asks His disciples, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?” The disciples came back with a couple of interesting answers. “Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” To us, this may be a bit confusing. Can you imagine being in the place of the disciples walking with Christ? Watching Christ multiply loaves of bread and a few fish to feed thousands or watching Him turn water into wine. Would you think to reply, “Oh yeah Jesus, people say you’re like John the Baptist.”
The disciples did not get it. They were looking for something else in Jesus. Jesus probably had a look on his face saying, “Come on! You almost got it!” when the boisterous and vocal Peter exclaimed, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” Bingo! That is what Christ was looking for and on that confession the Church was built.
What conviction Peter had in Christ! What zeal! I often wonder, if Christ were to ask me a similar question, such as, “What rock have you built your life on?” would I be able to reply with conviction and zeal or would I reply with embarrassment and shame. This question is an important question to ask every day. Peter built his life on the rock which is the Christ, the Son of the living God. He fully committed his life to Christ and he exclaimed it with fervor.
In time, we too shall exclaim our faith and commitment with fervor and zeal. We do it so casually with our favorite sports teams, friends, foods, music, and clothes. We do it so easily via facebook, twitter, snapchat, viber, and through other mediums. When we truly commit to our faith, when we participate in the sacraments, when we follow His commandments, when we come with a broken and contrite heart, we too will shout at the mountain tops that our foundation is like that of the Church, in Christ, the son of the living God.
We recognize that the foundation that we have placed ourselves on is crumbling. It is our choice whether we decide to move ourselves upon the rock of faith. We can only pack so much sand into the foundation. Christ, the True Foundation is the kind of foundation that withstands all. It can withstand any hurricane or tornado that comes menacing our way; the types of storms that plague us in every aspect of our lives. Our faith roots us in Christ and allows us to face the storms of this world. When we root ourselves in the True Foundation, our challenges are easily overcome and our darkened paths are enlightened. It is time we reassess what our foundation is, and put full faith in the True Foundation, the Christ, the Son of the living God.
#### Questions for Meditation:
1. What type of storms do you face in your life?
2. What foundation have you rooted yourself on? 
3. What active steps can you take to root yourself in the True Foundation?

## Feast of the Dedication of the Church
### Published on Nov 14 2013 by Libby Mathew, Dallas, Texas
Gospel of St. John 10:22-38
On November 10th we celebrated Hoodosh Etho, the “Feast of Dedication of the Church.” This goes back to the dedication of the Old Testament temple, after it had been captured by King Antiochus IV Epiphanes. He defiled and destroyed it as part of his mission to replace Judaism with the Greek religion and customs. Many Jews were killed or taken captive, and some were forcibly converted to the king's religion. Eventually, the remaining faithful Jews took back the temple, renovated, consecrated, and rededicated it back to God. They commemorated their freedom by celebrating flamboyantly, filling their homes and the temple with lights. This was known as the “festival of lights” or Hanukkah. We remember it today as the Dedication of the Church, which takes place on the second Sunday of the Church’s calendar year. If you think about it, it makes sense that it’s at the beginning of the year, after the Sanctification of the Church. Instead of counting down and dropping a big crystal ball to ring in the New Year, we celebrate by sanctifying and then dedicating the Church to God. As part of this feast, it’s important to remember that we as individuals are members of this Church being dedicated to God, and are being called to dedicate ourselves as well.
In 1 Peter 2:12, we are exhorted to live Godly lives in a pagan or secular society. The faithful people who withstood King Antiochus’s commands for the sake of their faith, though few in number, shine as remarkable examples for us, displaying great courage, perseverance, and faith. St. Solomonia and her 7 children were among these faithful. They refused to follow the king’s laws, and as a result, were brutally tortured and killed one by one in front of each other, saying they'd rather die than break God's law!
When we look at the lives of our saints and martyrs, it’s easy to read about them and not fully comprehend their sacrifices. St. Solomonia lived and raised her children to not only live for the faith, but also to die for the faith. By the Grace of God, none of us have experienced anything that extreme, but it is interesting that we can have such a hard time observing simple sacrifices like lent. Martyrs didn’t give up food, they gave up their lives! The Feast of Dedication of the Church is celebrated only once in the whole year, but we as members of the Church should constantly rededicate ourselves, renewing our minds and hearts continually. So the next time you observe lent, I challenge you to live a Godly life, just as St. Solomonia and her children did during King Antiochus’s reign.
#### Questions for Meditation:
1. How can you rededicate yourself to God?
2. What steps can you take to critically examine if you’re living a Godly life?

## Doubting Believers
### Published on Nov 21 2013 by Rev. Fr. M. D. Varghese, Konniyoor
Feast of the Annunciation to Zechariah
Gospel of St. Luke 1:5-25
Prostration during PrayerThe Gospel readings on the Sundays leading up to Christmas help to prepare the background and context of Christmas. The birth of St. John, the Baptist, the forerunner of Jesus Christ is also the preparatory event for the birth of our Lord. God had selected a dedicated priestly couple to give birth and to nurture that child. However, the doubtfulness of that priest, the punishment for that doubt and the faith that was strengthened through that punishment, form the theme of this week's Gospel reading.
I would like to present a few thoughts from this passage to engage our attention.
1. Mutual support and care:
 The lack of support in times of need is one of the greatest shortcomings in today's world. It is said about Elizabeth and Zechariah – "They both lived good lives in God's sight and obeyed fully all the Lords laws and commandments". Elizabeth was barren. Yet in Zechariah, we see a husband who did not abandon his wife because of her shortcomings. On the other hand, in Elizabeth we see a woman who was the wife of a priest but did not blame God or her husband's services to God for her shortcomings. Their mutual support and care is very evident here.
The lack of a support system is evident in families and individuals these days. In the past, both families and individuals had the support of parents, grandparents, relatives, friends, the church and their communities. The increasing number of suicides these days can be attributed to the lack of this support system. When a wife, husband, children, teachers and the community are able to come together and provide mutual support to understand each other's problems, the individual is able to overcome problems faced in life. Each of us should be able to become a unit of this support system.
2. The unbelief of a believer:
 Here we see a man who should have been firm in his faith and lead people towards this faith had momentarily given priority to his logical thinking. He momentarily forgot about the powerful miracles in his history that gave elderly Abraham and Sarah a son and also produced water from a rock. He was not supposed to do that.
Gabriel (man of God) was not able to bear this unbelief. The unbelief of a believer is not acceptable in the eyes of God.
In today's world it may be fairly accurate to say that there are more religious atheists than ever before. The shifting of churches to shopping centers is an indication of the Christian's hollowness. This indicates a priority for the temple of materialism rather than the temple of God. Which of these is our centre of worship? In some critical stages of our lives, God extends his helping hand. Does the thought cross our mind about whether we should take his hand? Each believer should have in his or her life, the ability to `taste and see that the Lord is good'.
3. Unity in prayer:
 Today's lifestyle is one that promotes individualistic thinking and personal space. This type of thinking is visible in all aspects of life like social, economic, political, cultural etc. This has now even affected families. Today we can even see a situation where a son may sit upstairs and email his mother to bring his meals up. Even is spiritual life, instead of family prayers, there is a tendency to move towards individual prayers or even a prayer-less life due to lack of time.
Zechariah, the priest, and the congregation are praying to God in unison. "According to the custom followed by the priest, he was chosen by lot to burn incense on the altar. So he went into the temple of the lord while the crowd of people outside prayed during the hour when the incense was burned" (St. Luke 1:11).
The fruits of Zechariah's and the community's prayer are shared by both parties. A childless couple was blessed with a baby (among all humans born from a woman, there was no one greater than him - Luke 7:28). The community got a prophet of justice.
Just like individual prayers are necessary, so too are community prayers necessary. A community that joins in prayer with the priest, is what the world needs today. Do we pray for those priests and high-priests that offer our sacrifices before God? Believers need to pray that their priests be given strength and guidance to overcome the many stresses and anxieties that fill their life. When a priest prays for the community and the community prays for the priest, the fruits of 'unity of prayer' can be experienced by all.
From this Gospel reading, may God our Father fill us with strong faith, mutual love and a mentality of prayer for each other.

## Why Me?
### Published on Nov 30 2013 by Rev. Fr. Mathew Alexander, Dallas, TX
The Feast of the Annunciation to St. Mary
Gospel of St. Luke 1:26-38
If anyone throughout all time had the right to ask this question, it has to be Mary. It’s only been a couple years since her parents passed away, she’s been raised in the Temple where her uncle Zacharias serves (probably didn’t have a playground or a PS4), and now she’s been betrothed to a great guy, a faithful and righteous man named Joseph (the Saint part comes later). And now as everything in her life is finally starting to settle and become normal, the Archangel Gabriel visits her with the message:
“Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name Jesus. He will be great”
Wait...what? Seriously? So...pregnancy outside of marriage (Leviticus isn’t so kind about that), and let’s be honest, what kind of guy is going to believe and stick around for this (oh there’s that Saint part).
Why does poor humble St. Mary have to suffer? Why do the innocent suffer? Mary had every right to ask, “Why me?” But her question isn’t exasperation, it’s a understandably curious “How?” And the answer she’s given is very simple “with God all things are possible”, and with great humility and trust in her heart, her next thought is “Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me according to your word.”
I know you’ve been there, maybe you’re there right now. Maybe you’ve had a rough week, a rough month, a rough year. Why me? Maybe you just celebrated your first Thanksgiving without your mom, your dad, your appacha, your ammachi, your best friend. Why me? Maybe you’re about to hit finals and you are struggling, with grades, with direction, with motivation, with friends, with that thing you don’t want your parents to know about. Why me? Maybe work is hell, maybe home is hell, maybe your heart is hell? Why me?
Why do the innocent suffer? Why does God lead us through darkness? Especially when it gets tough, nobody likes to fumble around in the darkness, nobody likes the fear of uncertainty. I know you don’t understand, neither did St Mary. But, in her confusion, in her anxiety, she steps out in faith and says “Let it be to me according to your word.”
Why does God lead us through darkness? Maybe you need to stop focusing on the darkness and start focusing on the words “God lead us.” God will never forsake you. He is leading you, because He loves you and is committed to you. You don’t always need to know where, or how to get there, or even how you are going to get through this (Mary didn’t understand the “How?” either), all you need to focus on is Who is leading. All you have to do is put your hope in God and take refuge in Him. He will take care of all of the details. “Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding.”[1]  (God wrote those words for you)
You don’t even need to know the words to say because Jesus provides them for you. “Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.” Every day of the week, every hour of the day, Thy will be done.
There is nothing that you will go through that God won’t help you get through. All you have to do is close your eyes, listen for the voice of the Holy Spirit, and “walk by faith, not by sight.”[2]
#### Questions for Meditation:
1. How many words are in the Lord’s Prayer (Our Father…)?
2. Did you just count?
3. Is that the slowest you’ve said those words all week? Don’t they sound a ton better when you say them slowly?
[1] Proverbs 3:5
[2] 2 Corinthians 5:7

## Christ-Like Humility
### Published on Dec 08 2013 by Jiji Mathew, Philadelphia, jijimathew23@yahoo.com
St. Luke 1:39-56
As I read the story of Mary visiting Elizabeth, I can’t help but notice something that I never noticed before.  The interaction, dialogue and mindset that these two blessed women have demonstrate a virtue that we as Christians must imitate.  That virtue is none other than humility.
We see Elizabeth, the much older cousin, greet Mary by saying, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me?” (Luke 1: 42-43).  Mary, knowing she will be call blessed for generations to come, responds by saying, “My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant” (Luke 1: 47-48).
In a time where Elizabeth’s age culturally demands respect, she offers hers first to her much younger cousin.  When Mary could have been most prideful of all women in her selection as the God-bearer, she humbles herself and refers to herself as His servant.  The humility these women show is truly noteworthy!
We see this virtue of humility throughout the bible, revealed to us perfectly in the incarnation of the Word.  From His humble birth in a manger to His blameless, voluntary death on the cross, God himself is the ultimate manifestation of humility.
St. Paul offers the most complete description and admonition to true humility in Philippians 2: 5-11 by saying, “Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.”
During this Advent season (and for the rest of our lives), let’s be reminded that in our daily process of becoming like God (theosis), we need to include and apply the virtue of humility.  In an age and culture where humility is seen as a weakness, let’s be reminded of the great men and women of the bible and church who have found strength and have given strength to others through humility.  And as with any virtue, credit and glory shall always be given to the Trinity from which all virtues originate.
#### Questions for Meditation:
1) In what areas of your life are you most prideful?
2) How can replacing that part of your life with Christ-like humility help?

## A Song of Hope
### Published on Dec 14 2013 by Sunita Geevarughese, Northwest U.S./Western Canada, sunita.geevarughese@gmail.com
St. Luke 1:57-80
The Christmas season is upon us – a time that brings a sense of wonder, laughter, loads of shopping, giving and receiving gifts, as well as (my personal favourite) Christmas carols.  Amongst all of these, we must not lose sight of the central message that accompanies this time of year – one of FAITH, HOPE, and LOVE.
Let us revisit one of the significant events that took place, leading up to the miraculous day that is Christmas.  This story involves a family we are all familiar with – Elizabeth, Zacharias, and the birth of their blessed son, John.
When he received news from the angel that he and his wife, Elizabeth, would bear a child in their old age, Zacharias’ rational way of thinking caused him to doubt and falter in his faith. This resulted in the loss of his ability to speak. It was difficult for Zacharias to believe that he and his wife could bear a child. From a scientific standpoint, they were too old!  If we were to put ourselves in this situation, I’m sure the majority of us would not believe John’s birth would be possible.
In Zacharias’ silence, he was able to reaffirm his faith and trust in God and His wondrous works. When the unlikely happened, and his son was born, Zacharias declared his son’s name and his tongue was loosed.  Immediately, ‘he spoke praising God’ (Luke 1:64). When Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, his song was one full of HOPE. He sang of God’s ability to redeem and deliver His people. It is through this prophecy that he was able to teach the people about God’s love, and build their faith.
Zacharias also sang of his son’s role in Jesus Christ’s life. John, would be ‘called the prophet of the Highest’ (Luke 1:76). When John grew, he moved to the desert and cultivated the field for the coming of Jesus. In that barren land, John sewed the seeds of faith and hope of the Messiah in the hearts and minds of the people.
Since John’s conception, he was bound to Jesus as the ‘prophet of the Highest’. His faith in the Lord was exemplified even as a fetus when he leapt in Elizabeth’s womb. When you whole-heartedly meditate on Elizabeth’s, Zacharias’ and, most notably John’s hope, faith and love in God, you’ll find it to be a beautiful and inspiring example for your life.
We call ourselves believers and followers of the Lord, but when faced with life’s challenges, it’s easy for us to default to the rational, rather than our faith.  After all, where is God when we need Him most? Why is it, at these times, we feel the deepest sense of loneliness?  I assure you, the Good Lord is there, with His loving arms outstretched, waiting for you to just reach out and grab hold. He has also meticulously placed companions to be shining examples of His love in our lives. Take that chance, and invest your hope and faith in our loving, heavenly Father.  You will surely find comfort in knowing that God’s love will never fail. Just as in Zacharias’ case, God will shower blessings upon us, far beyond our any of our earthly imaginations…when the time is right.
And now abide faith, hope, love these three, but the greatest of these is love (1 Corinthians 13:13)
#### Questions for Meditation:
1) How can you pass along the message of faith, hope and love not only during the Christmas season, but in your daily life

## Listen, Trust, Obey
### Published on Dec 23 2013 by Lijin Raju, Dallas, Texas, lijin.h.raju@gmail.com
St. Matthew 1:18-25
"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly. But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.” So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying: “Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,” which is translated, “God with us." Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to him his wife, and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son. And he called His name Jesus."
Scripture refers to Joseph as a just man. How was he a just man? Was he a just man according to the Jewish law or according to Christ or according to his own wisdom/reasoning? According to the Jewish law, if he was fair or just, he would have taken Mary and stoned her. If he was just according to Christ, he would have accepted her, stayed with her and cared for her. If he was just according to his own wisdom, he would have put her away secretly, not taking her as his own wife but also not letting her be harmed in any way.  Which one did he do? Faced with a dilemma, he was given discernment through the voice of an Angel and he did accordingly to the divine will of God. Now this is the Royal, Holy Family after which we should all model our families.
Christ’s birth is prefigured in Scripture. His incarnation was not a result of the fall of Adam. Rather the intention of the incarnation is there even before the creation of Adam. Through His incarnation, not only is He redeeming our sins through the Cross, but He is teaching us to become selfless and to lay down our lives for others as well (teaching us to become like Him). St. Mary accepted at her annunciation, that she would be the handmaid of the Lord. And now Joseph accepts, after having the angel explain to him how Mary conceived of the Holy Spirit, and not of a man. Joseph overcomes his uncertainty regarding Mary’s conception exemplifying that nothing will stand in the way of Christ and His Cross.
We recite our faith in the Nicene Creed, “And was incarnate of the Holy Virgin Mary by the Holy Spirit”. Joseph was not Christ’s biological father, but only legally. Christ was enfleshed (took on flesh) through Mary by the Holy Spirit. Joseph worried but then he listened, trusted, and obeyed. Therein lies the tie between Joseph and Christ for because he listened, trusted and obeyed the word of God, he was able to bear Christ in him as well.  Our purpose is to become like Christ. In order to become like Christ, we must understand Christ and sacrifice ourselves to allow him to be born in us. In a sense, we are preparing during this Nativity fast as if we ourselves are going to give birth to Christ. The Holy Spirit dwelt in Mary through her ear. She heard the word of God, accepted it, and was ready to do accordingly to God’s will. We must shut out the noises of this world that have reduced the word of God to a faint whisper, so that we may hear and allow it to dwell in us.
St. John Chrysostom says “For it is far more difficult, judging by human reason, for God to become man, than for a man to be declared a Son of God. When therefore thou art told that the Son of God is Son of David and of Abraham, doubt not any more, that thou too, the son of Adam, shalt be son of God.” As St. Athanasius simply put it, “the son of God became man so that man might become god”. This veritable truth of the Incarnation is what emboldens us as a fallen creation to be reconciled to the Creator.
May we be steadfast in listening, trusting, and obeying as we prepare during this Nativity fast to bear the son of God within us. Let us not stop there but rather go through the liturgical year ready to partake in his crucifixion and resurrection. Let us also abstain ourselves from preventing others to also bear Christ within them. Let us be purified by burning our sinful habits during the Christmas service and allow Christ’s light to shine through us.
#### Questions for Meditation:
1) Do we know what it means to bear Christ within us? Are we doing anything to find out?
2) Are you preparing yourself during this Nativity Fast to bear Christ within you?
3) What can you do to shut out the noises of the world so that you may be able to hear the word of God clearly?

## The Nativity Sermon of St. John Chrysostom
### Published on Dec 30 2013, taken from http://www.antiochian.org/node/21955
BEHOLD a new and wondrous mystery.
My ears resound to the Shepherd’s song, piping no soft melody, but chanting full forth a heavenly hymn. The Angels sing. The Archangels blend their voice in harmony. The Cherubim hymn their joyful praise. The Seraphim exalt His glory. All join to praise this holy feast, beholding the Godhead here on earth, and man in heaven. He Who is above, now for our redemption dwells here below; and he that was lowly is by divine mercy raised.
Bethlehem this day resembles heaven; hearing from the stars the singing of angelic voices; and in place of the sun, enfolds within itself on every side, the Sun of justice. And ask not how: for where God wills, the order of nature yields. For He willed; He had the power; He descended; He redeemed; all things yielded in obedience to God. This day He Who is, is Born; and He Who is, becomes what He was not. For when He was God, He became man; yet not departing from the Godhead that is His. Nor yet by any loss of divinity became He man, nor through increase became He God from man; but being the Word He became flesh, His nature, because of impassability, remaining unchanged.
And so the kings have come, and they have seen the heavenly King that has come upon the earth, not bringing with Him Angels, nor Archangels, nor Thrones, nor Dominations, nor Powers, nor Principalities, but, treading a new and solitary path, He has come forth from a spotless womb.
Since this heavenly birth cannot be described, neither does His coming amongst us in these days permit of too curious scrutiny. Though I know that a Virgin this day gave birth, and I believe that God was begotten before all time, yet the manner of this generation I have learned to venerate in silence and I accept that this is not to be probed too curiously with wordy speech.
For with God we look not for the order of nature, but rest our faith in the power of Him who works.
What shall I say to you; what shall I tell you? I behold a Mother who has brought forth; I see a Child come to this light by birth. The manner of His conception I cannot comprehend.
Nature here rested, while the Will of God labored. O ineffable grace! The Only Begotten, Who is before all ages, Who cannot be touched or be perceived, Who is simple, without body, has now put on my body, that is visible and liable to corruption. For what reason? That coming amongst us he may teach us, and teaching, lead us by the hand to the things that men cannot see. For since men believe that the eyes are more trustworthy than the ears, they doubt of that which they do not see, and so He has deigned to show Himself in bodily presence, that He may remove all doubt.
Christ, finding the holy body and soul of the Virgin, builds for Himself a living temple, and as He had willed, formed there a man from the Virgin; and, putting Him on, this day came forth; unashamed of the lowliness of our nature.
For it was to Him no lowering to put on what He Himself had made. Let that handiwork be forever glorified, which became the cloak of its own Creator. For as in the first creation of flesh, man could not be made before the clay had come into His hand, so neither could this corruptible body be glorified, until it had first become the garment of its Maker.
What shall I say! And how shall I describe this Birth to you? For this wonder fills me with astonishment. The Ancient of days has become an infant. He Who sits upon the sublime and heavenly Throne, now lies in a manger. And He Who cannot be touched, Who is simple, without complexity, and incorporeal, now lies subject to the hands of men. He Who has broken the bonds of sinners, is now bound by an infants bands. But He has decreed that ignominy shall become honor, infamy be clothed with glory, and total humiliation the measure of His Goodness.
For this He assumed my body, that I may become capable of His Word; taking my flesh, He gives me His spirit; and so He bestowing and I receiving, He prepares for me the treasure of Life. He takes my flesh, to sanctify me; He gives me His Spirit that He may save me.
Come, then, let us observe the Feast. Truly wondrous is the whole chronicle of the Nativity. For this day the ancient slavery is ended, the devil confounded, the demons take to flight, the power of death is broken, paradise is unlocked, the curse is taken away, sin is removed from us, error driven out, truth has been brought back, the speech of kindliness diffused, and spreads on every side, a heavenly way of life has been ¡in planted on the earth, angels communicate with men without fear, and men now hold speech with angels.
Why is this? Because God is now on earth, and man in heaven; on every side all things commingle. He became Flesh. He did not become God. He was God. Wherefore He became flesh, so that He Whom heaven did not contain, a manger would this day receive. He was placed in a manger, so that He, by whom all things are nourished, may receive an infants food from His Virgin Mother. So, the Father of all ages, as an infant at the breast, nestles in the virginal arms, that the Magi may more easily see Him. Since this day the Magi too have come, and made a beginning of withstanding tyranny; and the heavens give glory, as the Lord is revealed by a star.
To Him, then, Who out of confusion has wrought a clear path, to Christ, to the Father, and to the Holy Spirit, we offer all praise, now and forever. Amen.

## The Baptism of Our Lord
### Published on Jan 09 2014 by Archpriest A. Narushevich
The Feast of Epiphany
Gospel of St. Luke 3:7-22
On the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord a Christian is transported by his thoughts and feelings to a time long since passed. He directs his attention to that which was accomplished at the Jordan, and his heart is filled with reverent trembling.
A Christian contemplates Heaven opening over the Jordan and the Holy Spirit descending upon Jesus Christ in the form of a dove. He hears the very voice of the Heavenly Father: “This is my Beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased” (Matt. 3: 17). These unusual manifestations leave a profound impression in the heart of a believing Christian, evoking in it wonder and piety. From the depths of his enraptured heart the Christian involuntarily cries out: “Great art Thou, O Lord, and marvelous are Thy works, and there is no word which sufficeth to hymn Thy wonders.”
On the feast of the Lord’s Baptism a Christian meditates on the reason our Lord Jesus Christ, born without sin and not having sinned during His earthly life, should come to Jordan together with sinners in order to receive Baptism from John. The Christian calls to mind the sinful Fall of his forefathers; their punishment by the Lord God, required by God’s justice. He meditates on the sundering of man’s bond with his Creator and upon God’s merciful promise not to leave man without care. The Lord placed enmity between the seed of the serpent and the seed of mankind (Gen. 3: 15). The Lord promised even our forefathers that a time will come when his descendants shall crush the head of the Serpent-tempter. The Old Testament tree of life shall be replaced by the New Testament Body and Blood of the Only-Begotten Son of God, Who shall come to earth to save the world. “He who eats My Flesh and drinks My Blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day” - thus speaks Jesus Christ Himself (John 6:54). Because of this it was necessary that man again recognize his Creator and Saviour. It was needful to strengthen man’s faith in his Saviour. It was necessary for people to learn that the Father and Son, according to the word of Jesus Christ, are one: “The Father is in Me and I am in the Father” (John 10:38). And now our Lord Jesus Christ reveals Himself to the world. He comes to the Jordan to receive Baptism from John. During the Baptism of Jesus Christ in the Jordan the Holy Spirit descends upon Him in the form of a dove, while the Heavenly Father witnesses to Him with the words: “This is my Beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.” There was a true Theophany at the Jordan!
Here also at the Jordan it became clear to John the Baptist Who it was that had come to him to be Baptized from Nazareth in Galilee. “I myself did not know Him.” John said later, “but He who sent me to baptize with water said to me. ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’ And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God” (John l:33-34). The next day, looking at Jesus as He walked, John said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!” (John 1:35-36).
Pride was the source of the sin of our forefathers, for they desired to become like their Creator, “like God, knowing good and evil” (Gen. 3:5). Our Lord Jesus Christ, accepting baptism from His creature, shows an example of great humility. He, ‘‘though He was in the form of God, did not think it robbery to he equal with God, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross” (Philipp. 2:6-8). Christ the Saviour turns to John the Baptist not as God but as a humble Man asking baptism in order to fulfill ‘‘all truth.’’ Thus is pride overthrown by humility.
“Jesus, when he began His ministry, was about thirty years of age” (Luke 3:23). Before His entry into the public ministry of mankind’s salvation, Christ the Saviour comes to Jordan and receives baptism from John. As Man, in this sacred act He strengthens His powers by the grace of the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in the form of a dove. . . At the age of thirty the God-Man reveals Himself to the people, fulfilling by this act the custom of the Talmud-nourished Hebrew people who, especially after the return from Babylonian captivity, strictly kept the letter of the Law. According to the understanding of the Hebrews of that time, a man who had not reached thirty years could be neither a priest nor a teacher. And the Lord Jesus Christ, who came not to destroy but to fulfill the Old Testament Law, begins to preach at the age of thirty. It was at this age also that John the Baptist appeared at the Jordan with the call for people to repent.

## Called Suddenly to Serve
### Published on Jan 16 2014 by Joel John, Dallas, TX
First Sunday after the Feast of Theophany
Gospel of St. Matthew 4:12-22
All glory and honor be to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
The Gospel reading for this week comes to us from the Gospel according to St. Matthew 4:12-22.
A week after reading about the Theophany, we read about Christ beginning His ministry. Before He begins to travel and speak about the glory of God, He first gathers a group of fisherman, Andrew the first called, his brother Peter, and the sons of Zebedee James and John. A question that many people may ask is why did Christ seek out simple fisherman? Why didn’t He seek religious leaders that He could have deep, theological discussions with? Christ’s choice of disciples is reflective of His ministry. These fishermen were simple and uneducated but the beauty and the truly important thing to take away from this passage is how these disciples decide to join Christ. They literally drop what they are doing, Matthew 4:20, “They immediately left their nets and followed Him” and 4:22 "and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Him,” and start following Him. Although they had heard of the Christ’s teachings from John the Baptist, they had no idea who He was, and yet as soon as the grace of God was before them, they heeded His call and began following.
This is also reminds us of how other figures like Paul and Matthew were called by God suddenly to serve, and they didn’t hesitate, but were rather changed by being in front of the grace of God. We are all called to devote our lives to the service and glorification of God, and every Sunday when we enter the Holy Sanctuary we come before his grace and should be moved by it. I was once told that all Christians are called to a ministry and that ministry is our lives, and as such, everyday when we leave our homes, we should carry the Holy Spirit in our hearts. No matter what you do, whether you are a student, or working, or even if you’re just figuring out what you are supposed to do, you can do it in a way so that others can see the Holy Spirit in you.
Another thing to look at in the passage is the immediacy of how they left. It reminds us of how we are told 1 Thessalonians 5:2, "For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night." Time is a concept that is beyond God, and one that we as human beings often get caught up in. We feel like we have all the time in the world and often push things off until tomorrow, but as we see here, the best time to do something great, to allow the Holy Spirit to move in you, to make a difference in the lives of others is not tomorrow, its not a week from now, its not when things are less busy. The best time follow Christ is now. Take the lives of the disciples and the early apostles of the church as an example that our lives can be radically changed, and no matter your past, we have all been called to follow Christ. I pray that these words maybe an inspiration for those that read them and that the Holy Spirit might be moved in them.

## Come and See
### Published on Jan 23 2014
Second Sunday after Epiphany
Gospel of St. John 1:43-51
In this week’s Gospel we meet Philip and Nathanael, two disciples of St. John the Baptist, who are called to follow Christ in His ministry along with Andrew and his brother Simon (vv. 35-42). Philip, who has only just met the Messiah since the Theophany (Baptism of Christ), not only makes the personal decision to follow Christ, but goes a step further in calling his friend, Nathanael, to join with him.
Philip’s exhortation to Nathanael is a particularly interesting act. First, he demonstrates his understanding of the law and prophecy by recognizing Christ as the Messiah--something which we see many people struggle to accept throughout the Gospels. Secondly, when Nathanael questions the validity of Philip’s claims, Philip responds with three simple words, “come and see,” which are all it takes for Nathanael to make the first steps toward a life in Christ. Philip’s response demonstrates to us how simple it is to share the light of Christ with others. Yes, we can seek to educate and inform others through our words; however, sometimes the most effective way of bringing others to Christ is to simply bring them to experience Him themselves. If we, like Nathanael, are seeking to know God, we must open our hearts and make ourselves available to “come and see” Him by experiencing His love firsthand.
At times we can feel doubtful or hopeless of the world around us and question like Nathanael did when he asked, “can anything good come out of Nazareth?” because, when we are surrounded by darkness and sin, it can be difficult to see the light around and within us. But God continues to show us everyday that He has not forsaken us. St. Isaac the Syrian appropriately says, “Just as a strongly flowing fountain is not blocked up by a handful of earth, so the compassion of the Creator is not overcome by the wickedness of his creatures.” An active life in Christ shows us that goodness, however small, is still present in our hearts through God’s Image. No matter how far you feel you have strayed from God, He can still allow His grace to grow in you through His compassion; all you need to do is take the first step toward Him.
The manner in which Christ calls Nathanael is reflective of the eternal Trinity which was made manifest at the Theophany. First, Jesus’ foreknowledge and the Spirit guide Philip to come to Nathanael with news of the Messiah (v. 45). Second, God demonstrates that He knew Nathanael’s heart even before he was called (v. 48). Third, Jesus mysteriously foretells the miracles of His ministry and His passion of which Nathanael will soon become a witness (vv. 50-51). We see in this passage that Christ truly is, as Philip observed, the fulfillment of Old Testament law and prophesy. Additionally, we see that Christ is indeed God, the Son of Man, Who has humbled Himself in order to open heaven and form a covenantal bridge between God and man.
More than anything, this passage is a message of hope:
1. In Philip’s actions, we find hope that we can genuinely know and preach Christ’s Gospel through experience rather than limiting ourselves to words. St. Francis of Assisi states it perfectly when he says, “Preach the Gospel at all times, when necessary use words.” We should allow ourselves to be transformed into vessels of God so that others can see Him through our actions and come to experience Him themselves. 
2. In Nathanael, we see hope that good can come from the most unlikely of places and that God will save you if you open and purify your heart to receiving Him. St. Augustine says, “He Who made you without you, without you cannot save you.” The Christian life is an active one, and we cannot expect to know God if we remain under the fig tree without getting up to experience Him and receive His salvation when He calls.
3. Through Christ, we have hope that we can be reunited with God by emulating His selfless humility in our own lives. As St. John Climacus says, “An angel fell from Heaven without any other passion except pride, and so we may ask whether it is possible to ascend to Heaven by humility alone, without any other of the virtues.” Even at the beginning of His ministry, Christ is working toward His death and resurrection; we too should be working toward our death to this world and climbing the ladder to heaven. 
May God guide us to become vessels of His will, purified to receive His wisdom, and grant us hope to receive eternal life in Him.
#### Questions for Meditation:
1) Reflect on the following Qolo which we sing for Tuesday Compline. “Fear not, sinner, to turn back and tread the way of repentance. For your Lord seeks, and greatly will He rejoice if He finds you. He will stretch out His hand to you as He did to Simon Peter and will forgive your sins like the sinful woman and open to you, as to the thief, Paradise. He will rejoice and bear you on His shoulder, halleluiah! and embrace you.” 
2) What steps can you take in your life to become a vessel of Christ?

## Water and Spirit
### Published on Jan 31 2014
The Gospel of St. John 3:1-12
We see in this scripture passage a man named Nicodemus who believes that Jesus is indeed from God. However, like most of us, his faith is weak. He chooses to come to Him by night when not many people would see him interacting with Christ. Many of us can relate to Nicodemus in this sense. Where we have been taught who Christ is but choose to come to Him because the time is convenient – when either others are not looking or when it is a socially acceptable time to do so.
Although Nicodemus’s faith is weak, he still desires to come to Christ, like the most of us. When He sees Christ, he says, “Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.” Christ answers him saying, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God” (St. John 3:3).
Nicodemus responds in such a way we might have responded - “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?” Christ says to Nicodemus that the Kingdom of God could only be entered by one who is born of the water and the Spirit. Christ takes this encounter with Nicodemus, whose understanding is limited to the earthly sense, to share with him the heavenly mystery of baptism. Christ has given His creation the opportunity to be united with Him through this mystery – as the visible water of Baptism cleanses the body and the invisible Spirit restores the soul. St. John Chrysostom writes,
 “Paradise was entrusted to us, and we were shown unworthy to dwell even there, yet He has exalted us to heaven. In the first things we were found unfaithful, and He has committed to us greater; we could not refrain from a single tree, and He has provided for us the delights above; we kept not our place in Paradise, and He has opened to us the doors of heaven.”
We must remember that this new birth found in the Sacrament of Baptism is the beginning of our spiritual lives and not the end. It is our individual, Christian responsibility to continue to seek Him in all that we do – words that are spoken, thoughts that are imagined, actions that are committed, decisions that are made, etc. God desired us, desires us and will always continue to desire us. But a true relationship can only be full if this desire is shared willingly. We must humbly invite God to penetrate the depths of our soul and to share with Him the most vulnerable state of our being and allow Him to guide us to unity with Him. St. Paul writes, “if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught by Him, as the truth is in Jesus: that you put off, concerning your former conduct, the old man which grows corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, and be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and that you put on the new man which was created according to God, in true righteousness and holiness” (Ephesians 4:21-24).
Church tradition teaches us that Nicodemus grew in his relationship with God, following this encounter with Christ, to where he strongly proclaimed His faith. St. John wrote in his gospel of Nicodemus defending Christ before the Sanhedrin and preparing the Lord’s body for burial. Let the life of Nicodemus be a source of encouragement for us all to continue earnestly in our journey with the Lord.
#### Questions for Meditation:
1) St. Symeon the New Theologian said that “after baptism it is in our power to either persist willingly in the practice of the commandments of Christ, into Whom we were baptized…or to deviate from this straight way and to fall again into the hands of our enemy, the devil.” In what ways have you “persisted willingly” and “deviated from this straight way”?
2) What are the desires and priorities in your life today and where does strengthening your relationship with the Lord fit in?

## Love That Passes Knowledge
### Published on Feb 09 2014
Ephesians 3:13-21
St. Paul begins this epistle passage by comforting his readers (Ephesians 3:13) – to not look at his struggles and lose hope. Rather than continuing to comfort them with simply his own words, St. Paul responds by submitting their worries to the Lord. Often times, when we see or hear of someone in need, many of us might think to ourselves, “what is it that I can do for him or her?” We take on the responsibility of comforting others as if without us, comfort cannot be found. As St. Paul humbly did in this passage, it is important for us to turn to the Comforter Himself to provide others (and ourselves) comfort. It reminds us, as St. Paul explains later in this passage, that God is above all things imaginable and is more capable than any of us, as He is our Creator. This is not to take away from the works that we are called to do – but this is to say that we must seek out the Lord in all that we do, including our interactions with others.
St. Paul bows his knees (Ephesians 3:14), showing his sincerity in his desire to pray for his readers and prays to the Lord, to whom the heaven and earth belongs (Ephesians 3:15), that
  “He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints whatis the width and length and depth and height— to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us, to Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.” (Ephesians 3:16-21)
What if our personal prayers could look like this? What if our prayers for others could look like this? Often times, we pray for what it is that we want, what we feel that we need, what others want, what others feel that they need. We pray with the thought that we know what is best for ourselves and therefore we ask for just that - but there is a deeper request that is embedded in this prayer of St. Paul. He asks God to strengthen His people so they may invite Him to abide in their hearts. He prays that they, like the saints, may be able to understand that He is beyond the intellect of man and therefore know the width and the length and the depth and the height of His love and that by doing so, they might become full in Him. There is nothing more that we can ask God for that will complete us than the humble request to help us know Him better. As St. Paul reminds us in 1 Corinthians 2:9, “No eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined what God has prepared for those who love Him.”
#### Questions for Meditation:
1. In what ways can you more earnestly ask God in your prayers to dwell in your hearts?
2. How has your personal prayers changed over the past?

## Being a True Apostle of Jesus Christ
### Published on Feb 21 2014
2 Corinthians 4: 1-6
The purpose of St. Paul's second epistle to the Corinthians was to defend himself and the Gospel from the claims of false apostles rising in Corinth. The reading from the beginning of Chapter 4 is only a glimpse of St. Paul's efforts to reveal to the Corinthians the falsehood they are subject to. St. Paul alludes in v. 1 to "this ministry" which by looking at the previous chapter, we see is the "ministry of the Spirit" , that of the New Covenant. St. Paul reminds us that we have this New Covenant because "we have received mercy"  and therefore "we do not lose heart".  We must not forget that the New Covenant granted to us through Jesus Christ to save us from the wages of sin are not a result of our merit but rather the embodiment of the loving kindness of our Creator. St. Paul reminds the Corinthians of this great gift of mercy as the source for his strength to endure the challenges placed before him. While the Old Covenant was for the people of Israel, the New Covenant through Jesus Christ offers the gift of salvation to all who choose to accept it. As he says in v. 3 "those who are perishing" are those who refuse the mercy of God and thus the Gospel remains veiled to them by their own doing. He goes on to say in v. 4 that their minds "the god of this age has blinded" ; those who turn away from God are consumed by desires of the world and led into deceit and falsehood by Satan.
In v. 2 St. Paul speaks to the character that true believers should posses, that one should renounce the "hidden things of shame", one should not "handle the word of God deceitfully"  and therefore be able to commend themselves to "every man's conscience in the sight of God". The false apostles in Corinth were hypocrites and deceivers but St. Paul challenges us to be so pure of heart that we may be able to stand in holiness and be a true witness for Christ in front of every man. It is easy for us to become a false witness, to portray ourselves in a holy manner in certain situations while holding onto and manifesting our sins in secret.
The most significant distinction between the false apostles and St. Paul is seen in v. 5 "For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your bondservants for Jesus' sake".  The false apostles sought to discredit St. Paul and elevate themselves over him. St. Paul rebukes this motivation by reasserting that the purpose of his work is not to glorify himself but rather to glorify Christ Jesus the Lord. This serves as a warning for us as believers and a litmus test for us to consider in this day and age. The warning is for those who serve in any capacity to constantly evaluate what our motivation is and it should always be to bring glory to God so that we do not become like a false apostle. Secondly, when we hear  any message claiming to proclaim the Word of God, the first thing to determine is whether it is abundantly clear the speaker seeks to glorify himself or God. Let us pray that God grant us the discernment to not be led astray by the false apostles of this age.
In this short passage St. Paul teaches us several things. The first, to be mindful of the mercy of God that has offered us a means to reconcile ourselves to God and that by rejecting that gift we are willfully blinding ourselves to be led astray by Satan. Second, that we should stand as true believers in front of man and God without falsehood in our hearts. Lastly, that we must always remember that any service or ministry that we do is for the glory of God and not ourselves. Let us pray as we meditate on this passage that we may be true apostles of Jesus Christ as St. Paul was.
#### Questions for Reflection:
1) What are the hidden things of shame that you have not renounced in your life that keep you from being a true witness of Christ?
2) Have you had moments in your life where you realized your sole motivation for serving in a ministry was not to bring glory to God?

## Encourage One Another and Build Each Other Up
### Published on Feb 21 2014
1 Thessalonians 4:13 - 5:11
The primary purpose of St. Paul’s letter to the Thessalonians is to provide them with encouragement in the face of opposition and persecution. In this particular passage, St. Paul addresses the Thessalonians to inform them about the condition of the departed and the second coming of Christ. He makes it clear that death and the second coming ought not to be threatening, but a comfort for those who are righteous.
In the selection from Chapter 4, St. Paul clarifies the Christian perspective on death. He says not to “grieve like the rest of men, who have no hope.” (1 Thess. 4:13) but rather to have hope in Christ who will raise them up when He comes again. As Orthodox Christians we should all try to find strength in these comforting words amidst the grief and sorrow of losing or remembering a loved one. This passage is very fitting since the Church commemorated the departed clergy this previous Sunday and will remember all the faithful who have departed in Christ this upcoming Sunday.
In the portion taken from chapter 5, St. Paul calls us to be vigilant at all times due to the uncertainty of when the end of time will come. The analogy of the approach of “a thief in the night” (1 Thess. 5:2) paints a vivid picture of the unpredictability of when the day of the Lord will come. Therefore, our calling as faithful Christians is to be “alert and self-controlled” (1 Thess. 5:6) at all times. Now this may seem like an overwhelming task, however it is possible if we properly equip ourselves with the full armor of God. St. John Climacus says in his work, The Ladder of Divine Ascent, “Alertness is a quenching of lust, deliverance from fantasies in dreams, a tearful eye, a heart made soft and gentle, thoughts restrained, food digested, passions tamed, spirits subdued, tongue controlled, idle imaginings banished. The vigilant monk is a fisher of thoughts, and in the quiet of the night he can easily observe and catch them.” As the Great Lent approaches, let us also be vigilant and alert in our daily lives and catch our evil thoughts quickly before they overtake us. Let us also encourage one another and build each other up as St. Paul says so that we do not find ourselves alone in this great task.
#### Reflection Questions:
1. What are some things that we can practically do to encourage one another? How does this relate to accountability?
2. Why is vigilance important in our lives? What are some actions we can take to improve our vigilance?

## YOLO
### Published on Mar 02 2014
1 Corinthians 15:20-28
An ancient ossuary (bone box) with the inscription Yeshua bar Yehosef was discovered in 1980 near Jerusalem, leading some to proclaim these to be the bones of “Jesus, son of Joseph”. What does this do to your faith? Pause for a moment for the question to sink in - if evidence was given that identified the bones of Jesus of Nazareth, the Jewish man sentenced to death by crucifixion on decree of Pontius Pilate (fifth prefect of the Roman province of Judaea) … would you still be a Christian?
Far too many of us avoid the question, as we don’t like “theology” or are uncomfortable to share our views – everyone is entitled to their own opinion, right? We like to avoid discussions on religion and politics, and focus our mental and physical energy on our success, happiness, and fun. Life is too short, and we’d rather use our limited time to live to the fullest. You Only Live Once – YOLO!
The problem? This was never Christianity. To be a follower of Christ is to believe the Apostolic witness given to us by our forefathers -“Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures” (1 Corinthians 15:3).  Without Easter (the Resurrection of our Lord) there is no Christianity. Stories about the bones of Christ should be dismissed immediately and without a second thought by ALL Christians, as “if Christ is not risen, then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty” (v.13).
Everything we do, say, and think is centered on this FACT - Jesus Christ is the Savior and the Messiah, and God’s plan for our salvation is complete through His defeat of death. But do we really believe? Do we wake up each morning, as St. Basil encourages, and “nothing ought to be planned or purposed before we have been gladdened by the thought of God"?
St. Paul reminds (v. 20-22) that because He is risen from the dead, we are now alive. Any thought that “you only live once” ignores the gift of eternal life in Communion with our loving Father. We are a “chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people” (1 Peter 2:9). To enjoy eternal life we must believe and become like Him (theosis).
YOLO can only mean “You Only Live Orthodox” - a life centered on Christ, and not ourselves. Salvation begins by entering the Church, but is not immediate any more than standing in the lobby of a hospital heals us when we are sick. There is the constant struggle against what we may want to do if we look at the fruit of this world, but if we deny ourselves (Matthew 16:24) we continue to grow and become more like Him (Matthew 5:48). “A faith which has not overcome doubts and temptation is seldom a real faith” (Fr. Alexander Schmemann) and through our struggles we grow stronger in the Spirit. The Church gives us the discipline of fasting and the healing of the Sacraments to aid in this growth.
We will give an account on how we sanctified the path of life we chose. But, with faith and the Holy Spirit that dwells within us, let us face all adversity with humility, patience, and kindness knowing the eternal love of God that lies ahead.
#### Reflection Questions:
1. St John Chrysostom’s concludes Homily 39 on 1st Corinthians 15:11-28 (http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/220139.htm), by saying - “Knowing therefore these things, let us flee from the evil banquets of luxury and cleave to a spare table; that being of a good habit both of soul and body, we may both practice all virtue, and attain the good things to come, through the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to the Father, with the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, and honor, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.”. In your college setting, what examples of “luxury” and the countering “spare table” can you identify knowing the wisdom of St. John Chrysostom is showing us a way to counter temptation through healthy alternatives?
2. “What are you giving up for Lent?” It is inevitable to hear this question … however, this view of fasting is wrong and not what is intended by the Church. Instead, ask yourself the question - “What are you gaining this Lent?” Hopefully the answer will be “A closer relationship with Christ and restoration of that which has been lost." (based on a reflection from Fr. Evan Armatas of the Greek Orthodox Church)

## Spiritual Changing Room

Colossians 3:1-17
Apostle Paul’s letter to the new Christians in the city of Colossae addresses a group that has accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior and has just started to bask in God’s glory, yet they continue to live an unaltered, non-Christian lifestyle. The Colossians are simply surface Christians, ones who claim the title, but who do not live the life. Sound familiar?
Paul advises the Colossians, and us, that once we have accepted Jesus, son of God, by elevating our hearts and minds to Him, we must center ourselves in Him by disconnecting from earthly things. By properly aligning ourselves with Christ, we must cut off all earthly ties and traditions that we use for identification. We must strive to create ourselves in a new image, that of Christ.
Take a moment and think about the things in your life that you look to for meaning, purpose, validation and satisfaction. Are all of these thoughts that come to mind Christ centered? If not, you have allowed that something or someone to take God’s place in your life. Paul specifically addresses our issues with idolatry by identifying sexual immorality, lust, evil desires and greed as common areas of concern. We are charged to rid ourselves of these idols that will only lead to frustration, anger, slander, filthy language and a depressed demeanor.
These idols all have one thing in common – excess. God blesses us with many good things and he allows us the opportunity to enjoy those gifts, but he does not intend for us to focus on accumulating them. The gift of wealth is transformed to greed when we find joy in the accumulation of possessions or try to use the possessions as an identity. The gift of sexual intimacy is transformed to sexual immorality when we step beyond the single treasured relationship that God brings together and search for multiple sources for external sexual encounters. Either idol will leave you unsatisfied and disappointed because these extremes make terrible gods.
Paul asks us to put on new garments that allow us to have compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. He instructs us cover our heart with a tunic of forgiveness that shows we have forgiven any grievances from the past just as the Lord has forgiven us. He advises us to bind all the pieces together with a belt of love that serves to unify and bring peace. Finally cover yourself with a cloak of gratitude and present your newly adorned self to God singing songs of praise and thanksgiving.
Therefore, it is time for us to change our clothing. Let us vow to use this Lenten Journey to disrobe our bodies of the stained, torn and threadbare goods that are hanging from our being and put on the glorious new vestments that Jesus Christ provides, for we are all children of God.
#### Reflection:
1. What steps can we take to avoid converting our blessings to idols? 
2. What items of clothing are you going to focus on changing this Lenten Period?

## God's Triumphant Love
### Published on Mar 16 2014
Romans 8: 31-39
St. Paul’s epistle to the Romans was the only epistle written to a church St. Paul had not yet visited. As St. Paul is preaching the gospel to the people in Rome through his epistle, he makes one of the most beautiful and profound statements ever made. “For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord,” (Romans 8: 38-39). NOTHING can separate us from God’s love! We are His children, marked with the seal of Holy Baptism, and nothing can stop Him from loving us. However, we can separate ourselves from Him when we don’t truly pray, when we sin and don’t repent, and when we don’t make God a constant part of our lives. When we do all these things, we are separating ourselves from Him and the greatest gift of all, His love. God is a loving God and we see that throughout the Bible. Who else would sacrifice their own son for a world full of ungrateful, undeserving sinners?
Long before our parents conceived us, we were conceived in the mind of God. “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, and before you were born, I sanctified you,” (Jeremiah 1:5). God knew who our parents would be, when and where we would be born, our skin color, the number of hairs on our head, everything! We were all personally created by God to be in His likeness. Just imagine, God Almighty personally created each one of us and knew everything about us even before we were born! He wanted us to be here and although the world causes us to feel lonely and different, just remember, we mean everything to God! God created us so He could express His love to us. God’s love is the greatest gift we have and ever will receive. So how can we purposely want to separate ourselves from this love?
St. Paul also writes to the Romans that the only accurate way to understand ourselves is by knowing who God is and what He does for us. God is love and His love will triumph over anything Satan will try to use to keep us from God’s love. “If God is for us, who can be against us?” (Romans 8:31). During this Lenten period, let’s truly try to recognize the unconditional love God has for us and prevent Satan from separating ourselves from it. God will NEVER stop loving us and there is nothing greater or stronger than His love.
#### Questions for Meditation:
1. What are the things in our lives we let separate ourselves from God and how can we overcome them? 
2. Do I truly have a strong relationship with Christ? Does He know that I love Him and want Him in my life?

## Salvation
### Published on Mar 23 2014
Romans 5:1-11
Each and every person was created to live in intimate union with God sharing his eternal divine life. God said “Let us make man in Our image, after Our Likeness”. Orthodox Fathers explain that Man was created in the image of God, but was called to grow into the likeness of God by the use of his free will.
The fall (sin) occurred when man succumbed to his desire to be God without God by choosing the fruit of knowledge of good and evil rather than the One who had created all things. Fr. Alexander Schmemann wrote that the forbidden tree “is the image of the world loved for itself” i.e choosing the world to give life and fulfilment rather than God. This choice by Adam and Eve caused a separation from communion with God who is life, resulting in spiritual death. They could no longer bear to be in His presence, but sought to avoid Him. God sent them out of the garden so they would not have eternal life in the fallen state (by eating the from the Tree of Life).
Through the Old Testament we see that God was not willing for His good creation to be destroyed so he created a covenant with them. Through the Law (Ten Commandments), prophets He guided Israel through tough times. No matter how hard Israel (His chosen people) tried, sooner or later they found themselves sinning in thought, word and deed because the essential nature of man had changed from being God centered to being self-centered. God instituted the sacrificial system where the blood of a guiltless animal was shed to cover one’s sin. This was foreshadowing of the promised flawless, pure and righteous Savior, who would die in our place, as our substitute, to pay the terrible penalty for all our sins, on our behalf, once for all. He lowered Himself to the lowest depth of human existence-death so that He may raise us to eternal life.
Salvation however, is more than just appeasing a God who demands blood. “He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross” (Phil 2:8). God alone was able to renew the image of God in man. “God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself” (2 Cor 5:18). Through his sacrificial death Jesus healed the sinful nature of man and reestablished the potential for man to achieve Theosis (becoming like God, receiving the fullness of God’s life). By assuming the human nature, He has united it with His divine nature. We accept this in our baptism, which begins our journey towards the final goal that we were created for “growing into the likeness of Him who created us”.
So what would your response be if someone asked you “Are you saved?” An appropriate response as an Orthodox Christian would be “I have been saved, I am being saved; and I shall yet be saved”
Salvation is a constant growth in the life of Christ, a dynamic movement towards Theosis. Romans 5:1-11 kept reminding me of the three parts of salvation.
Salvation has to do with our past – Justification - we have been saved from sin and death through baptism to be united to God. Our union with God was possible because God took the initiative “But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him” (Vs 8-9). Belief or faith is the starting point of man’s salvation. “Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand” (Vs 1-2(a)). For the Orthodox; faith is not a blind leap, but an act of trust based upon the Testimony of the Church. Orthodoxy literally means “right glory/worship”, a proper understanding and faith in Jesus Christ and the Godhead. Some however teach that we only need faith based on St Paul’s teachings that man is justified by faith alone (Romans 3:28). This along with the teaching that salvation is achieved through grace misleads one to believe that man has no role in his salvation. To this misunderstanding, St. James wrote ”Faith, if it hath not works is dead, being alone” (James 2:17). Love and salvation cannot be forced. God has opened the gates but it is up to us to get in by doing our part- respond to His grace to produce spiritual fruits through Godly works.
Salvation has to do with our present – Sanctification: We are being saved through our daily walk and grow in life of Christ and the Spirit. Early Christian called themselves “The Way” because it was more than just another religion. It was as way of living in Christ, a journey with a goal to be with God. That way of life involved tribulations and persecutions which brings us to “We also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope. Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us” (Vs 3-5.). We are called to bring our self into subjection to God through humility and obedience. This does not mean however that man “earns” his salvation on his own merit; it only occurs by the grace of God.
Salvation has to do with our future – Glorification- “rejoice in hope of the glory of God” (Vs 2(b)). “We shall one day be saved will have our final glory when Jesus comes again” (Col 3:4). Matthew 24:13 states “But the one who endures to the end, he will be saved”. 
Let us all pray that God makes us worthy to be partakers of the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4).
#### Questions for Reflection:
1. Can man be saved against his own will? 
2. Does the Orthodox approach of human cooperation with God (works) take away from the work of Christ for our salvation?

## Strength is Revealed Through Humility
### Published on Apr 04 2014
Romans 7:14-25
Sunday of the Canaanite Woman
This week’s epistle reading may be difficult to read; however, it may not be difficult to relate to one’s self when read with patience. In the reading, St. Paul accurately depicts the inner turmoil of a man who is torn between the perceived pleasures of sin and the desire to follow the law – a familiar conflict for many Christians, especially in the midst of the Great Lent.
Holding fast to an ancient faith while living in a modern society, we find ourselves constantly struggling with the ever-widening gap between our two worlds. Even when we have been instructed in the faith from a young age, influences from the outside world can enter our hearts and minds, making it difficult to practice the faith and abstain from sin as we know we should. As St. Paul reveals, we allow ourselves to remain under the bondage of sin and easily sway under temptation. It is important to understand that we are not inherently sinful, but this sin “dwells in [us]” like an infection, tainting our deeds with evil whether we allow it to or not.
During fasting, we bring the law to our attention more than before, by training ourselves to consciously choose certain foods over others, we practice the discipline necessary to consciously choose certain thoughts and actions over others. This is how the law was intended – to reveal our sin to us so that we, in our humility, find the opportunity to repent at Christ’s feet. This same act is achieved through Christ in the accompanying Gospel reading of the Canaanite Woman (St. Matthew 15:21-31) as Christ’s interaction with this woman reveals the true strength of her faith by first humbling her.
Humility is a powerful trait and it can fuel the growth of spiritual life significantly, but it can sometimes be a source of discomfort. When we look back at humiliating moments in our lives, we tend to feel shame for our weaknesses and disgrace for our wounded pride. Imagine how it would feel if Christ rebuked your sinfulness in person, arguing that He died for you and yet you love sin more than Him. But God uses humility as a loving tool to bring us closer to Him, both through the law, as St. Paul mentions in Romans, and through Christ, who is the fulfilment of the law. St. Basil the Great discusses this phenomenon when he writes his discourses, “On the Origin of Humanity,” as he reminds us to remember that we are dust, that God created us out of nothingness in an act of pure love, and we are nothing without Him. It is a humbling feeling to think of one’s self as dust – something with no inherent value until blessed with the touch of God.
When we are humbled, it is important to find strength in this feeling, not of our own accord, but in Christ. Through Christ’s ultimate act of humility on the cross, He conquered all sin and death; therefore, we have strength in Him when we undergo torment over our spiritual struggles. When we find ourselves torn between obeying God’s will and succumbing to the world’s will, we find strength in Christ Who resisted the temptation of Satan in the desert (St. Matthew 4:1-11) and fully offered Himself to the will of God the Father in the Garden of Gethsemane (St. Matthew 26:39). Although we may not recognize it at first, God uses humility in our lives through the teachings of Christ and the traditions of the Church to make us stronger in our faith and love of Him. As we experience Mid-Lent, it is important to not be discouraged in our struggles but to allow ourselves to be transformed and strengthened by Christ as He stands as a symbol of hope in our hearts just as He is represented by the Golgotha which now stands fixed in the center of the church.
#### Questions for Reflection:
1. Is God trying to humble you? Are you able to rely on Him with unwavering faith when you feel weak?
2. How is Christ a symbol of hope in your Lenten struggles? How can Christ continue to be a symbol of hope after you complete this Lenten journey?

## Living Sacrifice
### Published on Apr 09 2014
Romans 12:1-15
St. Paul requests his readers to “present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God…” (verse 1). Many of us have been taught and have come to believe that our lives are for the Lord – so St. Paul’s supplication may not come to us as a surprise. Our Lord is a merciful God, one whose mercy the human mind cannot fully comprehend. King David speaks of the Lord’s mercy many times in the book of Psalms, once writing “the Lord is compassionate and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in mercy” (Psalm 103:8). In response to God’s mercy, St. Paul urges his readers to offer our living and dynamic selves as a sacrifice, in contrast to dead sacrifices that were offered in the past. He continues to write “do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God” (verse 2).
It might be edifying for us to become increasingly aware (in particular during this Lenten season) of how we have presented our bodies as a sacrifice to the world. And how we have conformed to this world. How often do we decide what to say, what to eat, what to wear, who to interact with, how to speak, where to spend our time, what we allow our eyes to see, mind to think, lips to say, based on how the world says we should? How often are we intentionally giving our lives, in its entirety, for God? We offer ourselves as a “living sacrifice” to God when our relationship with Him becomes the lens in which we see the world affecting how we navigate within it.
St. Paul continues this theme of being a “living sacrifice” by reminding his readers to remain humble and “not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think” (verse 3). He reminds us that we are all called to live for the Lord using our spiritual gifts, which is unique to each of His creation. Each of our gifts and callings, if used and followed properly, will lead us to be transformed into the image and likeness the Lord intended on us being. St. Paul provides us with an image of what our works will appear to be as we offer ourselves as a living sacrifice:
 “Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil. Cling to what is good.  Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honor giving preference to one another; not lagging in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord; rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing steadfastly in prayer; distributing to the needs of the saints, given to hospitality. Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.” (verses 9-15)
May we learn during this Great and Holy Fast to present ourselves as a living sacrifice each moment we are gifted with.
#### Questions for Meditation:
1) Identify resources that have helped you live for the Lord. In what ways can you utilize these resources during the remainder of the Lenten season to strengthen your relationship with Christ?
2) Be mindful of your thoughts for a portion of your day. What do you notice about how you are spending your thoughts? In what ways are they pleasing to the world? In what ways are they pleasing to the Lord?

## Walk in Love and Light
### Published on Apr 18 2014
Ephesians 5:1-14
In St. Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, he focuses on the Church, the Body of Christ. In chapter 5, St. Paul compares and contrasts the darkness of immorality and the light of Christ. God created us in His own image and is our Heavenly Father. As kids, many of us look up to our parents and desire to dress like them, talk like them and be just like them. In the same manner, we are children of God and ought to imitate Him, in action, thought and being.
There are two "L" words highlighted in this passage: love and light. St. Paul first calls us to walk in love, in the same manner Christ did. He humbly sacrificed himself so that we may attain eternal life. His sacrifice is compared to that of sweet smelling incense which is burned as a sacrifice which is acceptable by God. Later in the passage, St. Paul calls us to walk in light and to seek what is acceptable to God. Where darkness once triumphed, light now prevails.
On a daily basis we are in a spiritual warfare well beyond our comprehension. However, a remarkable aspect of God's love is that He calls all of us sinners to be saints. Saints! Not just "be the best Christian you can be" but live in a manner where the vices of this world are not even mentioned among us because we are fit to be saints. In verse 7, we are reminded to not even partake with those that deceive or take part in any unclean acts because God's wrath is inflicted on those who disobey. In today's world, this task is extremely difficult. We live in a society where it is often the norm to partake in unclean acts; it is so much a norm that it is almost wrong to excuse yourself from a situation involving drugs or alcohol. We get questioned on why we don't want to partake or if we are "too holy" to stay and participate. St. Paul reminds us that if we partake in these immoral acts, we must also expect to share in the wrath God has for those who disobey. But we must remember that we were not created to be men and women of this world, rather we are God's children - and even more, we are all called to be saints. How beautiful is that?
Verse 14 of this passage provides us with a friendly reminder of how we ought to live our lives. Walk in love and light...but also, like the prophets and apostles before us, we should call on those who have been bounded by sin, so that they may also walk in the light. It may be one thing to excuse yourself from sinful acts or live a righteous life, but it is an entirely different thing to also help out your fellow brothers and sisters in leading a life which imitates God.
As we approach Holy Week, we must reflect and look at our journey this Great Lent. Have we been able to walk in love and light and abstain from the sinful acts around us? As we continue to journey to the Cross, lets not only strive to walk in love and light, but also be a source of encouragement and support for others who have struggled or desire to do the same.
#### Questions for Reflection:
1) How can you change your daily actions to answer the call to be a saint?
2) What is more difficult for you - leading a Christian life or helping others lead one?

## Armor of God
### Published on Apr 18 2014
Ephesians 6:1-24
We see from the references made in this passage that St. Paul, as prisoner, is writing to the Ephesians to evangelize the Church. St. Paul writes, “And you fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath, but bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord.” We see that especially at a young age, it is the parents’ responsibility to provide children with spiritual guidance and help children engage in spiritual practices with the best understanding of what they are witnessing. In St. John Chrysostom’s Homily, he comments on a common misconception that it is only the ‘business of monks’ to engage in the divine Scriptures, but rather it is the duty of every Orthodox Christian, both clergy and layperson, to uphold the study of the Holy Scripture and the teachings of the Church. He says,
“How is it not absurd to send children out to trades, and to school, and to do all you can for these objects, and yet, not to ‘bring them up in the chastening and admonition of the Lord?’” (Chrysostom, Homily XXI, On Ephesians).
Our fascination towards our monetary success stems from our tunneled vision on the short term and our lack of both trust and faith in God. St. Paul reminds us in this passage that we must bring up our children to apply themselves to the reading of the Scriptures and to constantly hold ourselves responsible primarily for the study of the Scripture and the doctrines of the Church.
In Ephesians 6:11, St. Paul writes, “Put on the full armor of God, for you to be able to stand against the wiles of the devil because for us the wrestling is not against blood and flesh but against the principalities, against the authorities, against the cosmic rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of evil on account of the heavenly things.” In our daily lives, we may find struggle in our spiritual warfare against the one who is skilled in the art of war, tempting, and deception. St. John Chrysostom says,
  “He speaks not merely of doing the deed, but of completing it, so as not only to slay, but to stand also after we have slain. For even after the victory, we must stand.” (Chrysostom Homily XXII)
Here we see that in this spiritual warfare, it takes vigilance and completely dependence on God to not only fight against the evil forces of this present day, but to shield ourselves from our daily adversary towards temptation. As the Great Lent comes to a conclusion, let us continue to be aware of our opposition surrounding us and let us be vigilant in our study of Scripture and faith.
#### Reflection questions:
1. How does temptation play a role in our daily lives? What are ways of actively putting on the ‘armor of God’?   
2. Why do we struggle in prioritizing our spiritual progress over our monetary success? How can the eternal kingdom and complete faith in God help us realign our priorities?

## God is Witness
### Published on May 02 2014
1 Thessalonians 2:1-13
St. Paul writes to the Thessalonians, who have “turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come” about how he approaches preaching the Gospel (1 Thessalonians 1:9-10). He explicitly writes that his preaching did not come from a place of “error or uncleanness or deceit” (vs. 3) but from above. He continues to write that while preaching he did not “seek glory from men” (vs. 6).
Many of us might think initially that this is a passage that does not apply to us because we don’t “preach”. Many of us might think that preaching is reserved to only those that are ordained. How we act in the world speaks much about the God that we know. How do we treat the poor? What do we think about the poor and what he or she deserves? With what mind do we think of those that have hurt us in the past? How often do we seek revenge? How do we respond to our apathy? How do we respond when circumstance don’t go our way? How do we treat our parents and our family members? To what extent do we love those who care about us? What are our minds filled with throughout the day? What do we desire? What hurts us? As the common saying goes, we may be the only Gospel that one encounters in his or her life.
The words St. Paul writes can be applicable to each of us as he asks us to look at our motives and remember that “God is witness” (vs. 5). Despite the expectation others or ourselves place on us within our community, family, friends, or wherever else, the most important question is to turn to our Creator and ask ”what is it that You expect from me?” With what intention do we express our faith? Is it with the error or uncleanness or deceit or to seek glory from men, as St. Paul says? Is it so that others know “how Christian we are?” In all that we say and do, we must remember that it is our God that created us that knows our hearts and intentions better than all men. Solomon prays in 1 Kings 8:37 “for You alone know the hearts of all the children of men.” In the same way He knows our deepest desires, He is also aware of our intention and motives despite our unwillingness to admit them. As it is written in 1 Samuel 16:7, “For the Lord does not see as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.”
#### Questions for Reflection:
1) Observe the motives behind your verbal exchanges for a period of time – an hour, half a day, or a full day. What do you notice?
2) Often times it is easy for us to use what St. Paul says in this passage to point our fingers at others and explain how they might fail to follow what is written. What can we do to point that finger back at us? Why should we do so?

## To Become a Good Leader, First Become a Good Servant
### Published on May 16 2014
Hebrews 3:1-13
Second Sunday after New Sunday
The Pauline Epistle for this Sunday calls us to evaluate the depth of our own faith much like Simon Peter was asked by Christ in the accompanying Gospel passage (St. John 21:15-19).
At the beginning of the reading, we are reminded of the role of Christ both as the representative of God before man and the mediator of man before God. We also see Christ as the architect who built the Church – which is composed of us, the body of believers. It is important, when evaluating our faith, to first consider the One to Whom we are asked to remain faithful. He is God, and at the same time, He is “faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was faithful” (v. 2). St. Paul makes an interesting point when he progresses to relate the nature of the Church and Christ to be like that of a house and an architect. For some of us who may be adamantly involved in serving the Church, we can, at times, feel more devotion and more love for the institutional aspect of the Church than we do to Christ Himself. Sometimes we can become so swept away by being a part of this community, planning and attending events, seeing our friends, and singing songs that we forget the underlying reason why we ought to be doing all this. Then, perhaps, one dark day we might suddenly come to the realization that we have no depth of faith at all – and it can be shattering to realize this, just as terrifying it was to Peter when he realized he had denied his Master three times at the time of His passion. Therefore, when St. Paul makes clear that “He who built the house has more honor than the house,” (v. 3) he is reminding us that the Church is consecrated to the glory of God, and it is ultimately to God that our honor and love should be directed, because “He who built all things is God (v. 4).”
It is interesting to note at this point the manner in which we were addressed in verse one, “holy brethren” and “partakers of the heavenly calling.” At times, we can really let titles like these go to our heads, especially so soon after witnessing the Feast of Resurrection. Perhaps we participated in Holy Confession or partook of the Holy Eucharist multiple times to the point where we just feel like holy people, living holy lives, just basking in holiness like vacationers on the beach. Yet, in verse twelve, we see that the purpose of this passage is actually to warn us to beware of unbelief and hardness of heart because achieving true holiness is no easy task. This passage reminds us that standing firm in our faith is a real struggle because sin can be attractive enough to tempt us away from God. We can even be deceived to the point where we feel like we are doing everything right in serving the Church, and yet, we can be spiritually far from God at the same time. We may think that because we were baptized, take Holy Qurbana, wear prayer ropes, or observe fasts that we can somehow be immune to sin. In fact, it is our own spiritual laziness that can create this illusion of immunity which will subsequently open the door to sin, doubt, and unfaithfulness – qualities that could effectively discredit any leader in the Church.
To become a good leader, you must first become a good servant. Christ set an example before us by remembering and remaining faithful to The Father throughout His earthly ministry; the same example is shown to us in the Holy Apostles and Martyrs. Therefore, when we seek to become leaders in the Church, we must first be unconditionally faithful servants, so deeply in love with Christ that we are willing to give ourselves to Him completely, especially when we are tempted by the fallen world to give up. In this manner, we each have the opportunity to shine the light of Christ through the world “if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end (v. 6).” If, however, our hearts do not truly know and love the Master whom we serve, then we have good reason to beware of being “hardened through the deceitfulness of sin (v. 13).”
May God grant us the strength to remain faithful to Him, standing firm in the face of temptation, so that we may honor and serve Him like the Holy Prophets, Apostles and Martyrs before us. Let us learn to serve our Father and remember Him in all that we do just as Christ demonstrated to us through His passion. Let us continue to fight against the demons and temptations around us and not become complacent in our faith.
#### Questions for Reflection:
1. Reflect on the corresponding General Epistle reading for this week: Acts 4:8-21. How does this passage relate to the theme of remaining an unconditionally faithful servant to Christ? 
2. Reflect on the corresponding Gospel reading for this week: St. John 21:15-19. How deep is your faith and love of God? Can you confess to loving him with sacrificial and self-emptying love, or do you only feel brotherly affection towards Him? (See the Orthodox Study Bible footnote at 21:15-17).

## Faith in God
### Published on May 24 2014
Hebrews 11:3-6
Third Sunday after New Sunday
In this week’s Pauline epistle we see St. Paul writing a very important letter to the Hebrews. As you read the letter a familiar idea is brought up over and over again and that is faith. Faith is something we all struggle with both in our physical life and our spiritual life. Our physical life consists of relationships with our family and friends, and having faith in each other can strengthen the meaning of that relationship. The spiritual life is the relationship with our Father above, and just like the physical life our faith in Christ can strengthen the relationship between us and Him, but the difference is that when we lose faith in God our life falters and we fall. When we fall it creates a tower effect. Our Faith in God is the base and once it is gone then everything else in our life begins to fall apart. There are many great people in the Bible we can learn from that doubted, but understood that having faith in God is the greatest weapon someone can have. We see these people named within the letter and how their faith in God brought great things in their lives.
Faith is an encounter between us and God. He unconditionally loves us and takes the first step in believing in us. Christ helps us understand his presence and that he is there for us. The problem with faith is that it is usually a one way street, especially in this day in age. As modern day Christians we look for physical evidence of Christ’s presence and when asked why people do not have faith in Christ they say because they do not see it or do not have enough evidence to believe it. People do not see miracles anymore and when they go through struggles in life they ask “where is Christ”? As Christians we cannot fully understand God, He does things because he has a plan. St. Augustine talks about a story that many people can relate to. St. Augustine was walking along the seashore one day. His thoughts were centered on God. He passed a little girl filling a hole in the sand with water, He asked what she was doing. The reply was, “I’m emptying the sea into this little hole I’ve dug.” The wise theologian smiled and said to him, “I am trying to crowd the infinite God into this finite mind of mine.” St. Augustine says such fruitful words at the end of his story. As human beings we strive to know and understand everything but like St. Augustine said how can our feeble minds comprehend God and because of that people doubt God and lose faith. This is somewhat unfair because God is taking that first step in the two way relationship of faith.
Fr. Anthony M. Coniaris, a Greek Orthodox priest in Minnesota, is the President of Light and Life Publishing and in one of his books, “Introducing The Orthodox Church,” he talks about how the early church did not need miracles or signs to have faith in God. They stood firm in the faith and came to the temple to hear the words of Christ that they may use it in their daily lives. What we as modern day Christians lack is what Abraham had when he was asked to sacrifice his son, what Noah had when he was asked to build an ark to continue the human race, and what David had when he was asked to become king of Israel. Remember that each one of these great people did have some doubt but understood that with God all things are possible. We must also understand that through thick and thin our Father in heaven will lead us on the right path as long as we have full faith in his words.
#### Questions for Reflection:
1. As an Orthodox Christian how do you keep faith in God when things get hard in life? 
2. How can modern day Christians bring the ways of the early church back into our daily lives?

## Living By The Spirit
### Published on Jun 17 2014
Galatians 5:16-26
St.Paul’s epistle to the Galatians speaks about how we can practice the gospel teachings in our daily lives. We need to “walk by the Spirit and … not gratify the desires of the flesh.” [Galatians 5:16]. By desires of the flesh, he means worldly pleasure and acts of sin we commit when we loose our self-control. When loosing self-control, you can potentially fall into a cycle of impurity and discord. And with discord comes hatred, jealousy, rage; God has given us free will, but we should not use it to hate others.
This passage sums up what Christian life is really about. We need to be living our lives by the way of the Holy Spirit or we “will not inherit the kingdom of God” [Galatians 5:21].  We should all aspire to be more like Christ in Spirit and to do that we need to embrace characteristics like self-control, faithfulness, goodness, and kindness.
In Romans 8:9-11, it says that our body is already subjected to death because of sin, but we will be saved due to the righteousness of the Spirit. God has given us a chance to be saved, but the problem is we need to fight the worldly temptations and live a good life to take that chance.
If we give in to worldly desires, we are giving into sin and temptation. 1 John 2:15-16 says “Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world”. We cannot decide to give into worldly desires and feelings such as jealousy towards our brothers and still say we live in the Spirit and love God the Father. Although we may fall multiple times, God’s mercy and love enables us to get back up. It does not matter how many times one falls into the same act as long as they decide to get back up and continue the fight. But, how many times can you ask for forgiveness before it just becomes a routine for you and means nothing? Living your life by the Spirit will help you overcome worldly desires and live like Christ, which is what we as Christian want to ultimately do.
#### Reflection Questions:
1. Are we showing self-control when faced with temptations?
2. How often do you give in, thinking this will be “the last time”?

## One Love, One World
### Published on Jul 01 2014
Ephesians 2:11-22
"Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right." Bob Marley put it down in his tune for the song named ‘One World, One Love.’  But then as we read through the Holy Scriptures of St. Paul’s instruction to the Ephesians on the riches Christ has to offer the Church we get a different notion to the term ‘One World, One Love.’
During the earlier times of Old Testament, an ethnic distinction was prevalent between the Jews and the Gentiles on basis of the flesh (Jews being circumcised and the latter being uncircumcised). This worldly distinction/ barrier was what separated these two groups of society even to the extent of faith being received. Lets bring this same situation forward to this 21st century. When this world is bent on creating distinctions/comparing on which society/cast is set/ needs to be ‘saved’ St. Paul ensures that he answers all these queries by providing the verse stated in Ephesians 2:13-16, “But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation, having abolished in His flesh the enmity, that is, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, so as to create Himself one new man from the two, thus making peace, and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, thereby putting to death the enmity."
Let’s break the above verse to simplify this notion of ‘One World’. This world which has divided itself into innumerable groups based off various ordinances/practices can be brought together through one unifying factor - which is through Christ Jesus. This unified humanity was created upon the Incarnation of the Son of God, and His death and Resurrection raised this unified humanity to God. In short, the only factor to break down the walls to praise God in ‘one voice’ and in turn be raised up to God - Jesus Christ.
St. Paul goes on to exhort that the Holy Church which has been established by Christ Himself is designed to be united as one which in turn inculcates spiritual oneness. A calling we all need to adhere to so that the society around us can see through us the oneness in Christ which breaks all barriers of language, cast, race and speaks the common language of Salvation through Him. St.Paul sums up this description of oneness within the Church as “..Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone, in whom the whole building being fitted together, grows into a Holy temple in the Lord...”
If the Church or for the matter of fact this world is build on this cornerstone of Jesus Christ it would indeed be appropriate to switch around the notion of ‘One World, One Love’ to ‘One Love, One World’. Through our ‘One Love’ for our Saviour Jesus Christ being the only way this world can attain the status of ‘One World’.
“There is one body and one Spirit..one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.”
Ephesians 4:4-6
#### Questions for reflection:
1. As Christians what can we do in terms of words, deeds and actions to convey our oneness in Christ to the society to spread this word of one love?
2. How can we implement the notion of One Love, One World in our own personal life to bring to light the love of our Savior Jesus Christ?

## Perfect Love
### Published on Jul 07 2014
1 Corinthians 12:28-13:10
Feast of St. Peter and St. Paul
On the Feast of St. Peter and St. Paul, the Church celebrates two great pillars of the faith who perfectly demonstrate both the diversity and synergy of spiritual gifts. While St. Peter spent much of his ministry urging for unity within the early Church, as seen in 1 Peter 3:8, “Finally, all of you be of one mind, having compassion for one another,” St. Paul is best known for his missionary travels and challenges to the Church to expand ministry to Gentiles as seen in Romans 1:16, “…for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek.” In these two leaders we see two calls to love—one within the Church and one beyond the Church—that work together to witness Christ’s love.
In the Pauline Epistle, taken from 1 Corinthians 12:28-13:10, St. Paul notes that there are various types of spiritual gifts with their own hierarchy; however, love is superior to all gifts surpassing even prophecy and miracles. What makes love so powerful is that it is eternal, complete and fulfilling—that is, it does not fail or cease over time, but rather, it is perfect in itself (vv. 8-9). This is clearly shown to us in Christ who, through His earthly ministry, perfectly fulfilled Old Testament law and prophecy as the embodiment of God’s love and, therefore, established a New Covenant with all mankind. One remarkably unique quality of this superior spiritual gift is its accessibility to all mankind: anyone is capable of love regardless of their identity or background. Nevertheless, it is certainly not easy to practice perfect Godly love, as explained in verses four through seven.
In the corresponding Gospel passage for this Sunday’s feast (St. Matthew 20:1-16), the parable of the laborers illustrates that God rewards his believers equally without giving preference to anyone who may have found the Church sooner than another man. At that time, this parable directly addressed the relationship between Jews and Gentiles as believers of the Church. But how does this relate to us today? How do we love both those within the Church and those outside the Church? The answer can be found in St. Matthew 22:34-40 when Christ declares love as the greatest commandment—first due to “the Lord your God” and second due to “your neighbor.”
With no specific restrictions on who is considered as a “neighbor,” Christ instructs us to “love your neighbor as yourself (v. 39).” It is important to note that this does not imply that we should love others in the same way that we love ourselves, because that idea starkly conflicts with the manner in which Christ lived and loved on earth. Instead, we are called to love others as if they are the very same nature as us. This type of love allows us to show empathy and identify with others even though they may be different than us. Even within our own churches, we have a tendency to fall into cliques or social circles and, in many cases, this practice can breed a culture of exclusivity. Outside of our churches, we may show personal biases against complete strangers by making unwarranted assumptions about them. However, what Christ refers to in this verse is that, if we have truly devoted our love to God, then we should be able to see that God’s image and likeness is present in others just as it is present in ourselves, regardless of who they are or where they came from. This type of love is possible when we begin to recognize that true and perfect love is not exclusive or conditional, it is boundless: accessible by all both to give and to receive. Therefore, it is important for us to regard ourselves as no more a saint and no less a sinner than anyone else.
Let us pray for mercy that we may be able to achieve such a perfect love where we are able to identify with others, recognize God’s image in others, and overcome our own selfishness and pride. Let us strive to love as fiercely as Christ loves us, without fear or prejudice, in hopes that it will spread throughout the entire world.

## Team Effort
### Published on Jul 24 2014
1 Corinthians 16:14-22
It's championship season in the sports world, as professional tennis, hockey, basketball, golf, and soccer players pursue the pinnacle of their sport during the summer. And for us amateurs, regional volleyball and basketball tournaments give us a chance to hone and exhibit our skill as we take a break from school or work. With the World Cup nearing a finish, and many of our thoughts drifting to championships of our own, we'll take a sports-centric look at this week's passage.
Having written 13 of the 27 books of the New Testament, St. Paul is one of the most significant figures of the Bible. But in this passage, as Paul bids farewell at the end of his first epistle to the people of Corinth, we see that he wasn't alone. Paul acknowledges some unsung heroes - his teammates Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus - who served as letter carriers. Paul's support staff wasn't prominent, but they were instrumental in Paul's effort to spread God's Word through letters. This passage shows that we should allow ourselves to be inspired by each other's faith, and to find joy and gladness in the presence and efforts of our brethren. Just as good teammates should be complements for one another, we see that Paul's support staff provided what was lacking on the part of the Corinthians, and that "they refreshed my [Paul's] spirit and yours [the Corinthians]" (v. 17-18). The passage includes the simplest and most necessary bit of advice for any teammate "Let all that you do be done with love" (v. 14), which is a message that reverberates in each of this week's Bible readings.
This week's evening Gospel reading (Mt. 14:14-23) echoes the theme of team work, through St. Matthew’s account of the feeding of the five thousand. We know our teammates may not always be perfect - like the disciples when they suggested "Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food" (Mt 14:15). But Jesus' response was one borne of love, as he utilized his supporters to serve. By doing so, Jesus elevated his teammates' games, and made them better people by giving them a game plan that allowed them to be more involved.
Jesus' team of disciples is something we all studied in Sunday School, so let's do what athletes do during acceptance speeches and bring some love and attention to the fans. At Sunday's morning prayer Gospel reading (Lk. 10:17-24) and Holy Communion Gospel reading (Lk. 10:1-6) we'll witness the fervent support brought by "The Seventy" - seventy people out of the multitude who were appointed and sent out by the Lord to act as missionaries and evangelists. They left with passion and conviction, and "returned with joy, saying 'Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name'," (Lk. 10:17). Jesus redirects their boundless joy and pride in their work in Lk. 10:20 "do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in Heaven." By seeking input from unlikely places, Jesus was able to give his enthusiastic supporters an unfathomable level of joy. Christ actions should remind us to reach out beyond our comfort zones to let people be a part of the work that we try to accomplish, so that they may share in the joy of success.
Doing our part is what Sunday's general epistle (Acts 6:1-7) will be about. Just like our sports clubs have specific positions, the Lord's team has a variety of appointments roles to be filled. As the Church was growing exponentially, the Apostles realized they would need to delegate responsibilities to new leaders within the growing brotherhood, so that they themselves could continue to "give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the Word," (Acts 6:4). Trying to accomplish our tasks all on our own - whether in the sports realm, professional world, or in our spiritual walk - is something that will bring us stress and struggles that can surely crush us as individuals. New problems arise daily in our lives, just like for the burgeoning Church in Acts Ch. 6. And just like a coach replaces an injured player, we must be willing to delegate and prepare people in our lives to fill the support positions that we need in order to survive our trials.
It takes a great deal of effort to be a great teammate in sports as well as in life. But the key to all of this effort is found back at the very first verse of this week's Pauline Epistle - "Let all that you do be done with love" (1 Cor 16:14). Through Him, may we find the strength, courage, and love to handle all of life's challenges together. Let us acknowledge everyone who has been a part of our team in life so far, and may God make us worthy to be the perfect teammates for all of the people in our families, Churches, and communities.

## New Creation and the Power of Reconciliation
### Published on Aug 04 2014
2 Corinthians 5:14-20
In 2nd Corinthians 5:14-20, St. Paul writes to the church of Corinth about New Creation and Reconciliation. Both of these subjects go hand in hand when attempting to live the ultimate Christian life. In this reading, the New Creation refers to baptism and how if one is in Christ then their old ways have passed away and they are born new (verse 17). Reconciliation with Christ means to restore our relationship with Christ. If we as individuals allow ourselves to recognize the fact that we are all born new through the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ and humble ourselves to reconcile with Christ, then we will all be able start a new life within him.
Verse 15 perfectly sums up how we as Orthodox Christians should aim to live our lives: no longer for ourselves, but for Him who died for us and rose again. This can be a very sensitive topic because many of us do not like to discuss how we personally live for Christ nor do we like to be told we may be doing something wrong. Many of us just aim to live purely by faith alone and disregard the works of a Christian that come from a true faith. We have all been invited to live for Christ and we hope to receive eternal life. Regardless of what struggles we may be experiencing, big or small, we must all remember that no matter what we do in our lives, we do it for the Lord. When we humble ourselves and allow God to fully enter our hearts and minds, we take a step in the right direction. Remember there is more to life than just our individual needs and wants. God has a plan, but we must be willing to allow him in and allow him to guide us.
Probably one of the hardest things to do as a person is to reconcile with someone. To reconcile means to restore the relationship between two people. Reconciliation is forgiveness in action. In verses 18-20, St. Paul is pleading for us to be reconcile with God. Through Jesus Christ, God has been reconciled with us. The innocent, Jesus Christ, voluntarily lowered himself for our sins. In verse 19 there is a beautiful fact that many of us forget about in our daily lives: “not imputing their trespasses to them.” Christ’s crucifixion was a rescue mission. Christ rescued us from death and sin through his death on the cross. Through the participation in the life of Christ, his death and resurrection, we are reconciled with God. Another good way to reconcile with God is through the sacrament of Holy Confession. Holy confession allows one to be assured they have received divine forgiveness. This sacrament is perfect for when a habitual sin has overwhelmed a Christian or when a Christian has stopped growing spiritually and needs to reexamine their priorities.
The life of a Christian is not an easy one, no one said it would be. However that does not change the fact that we all are called to reconcile with God and live within Him. The very reality of our lives as Christians is that we constantly live in sin. Even when we do not realize it, we sin and hurt our relationship with God. The act of reconciliation is not a one-time thing. That is why God has taught us how to ask forgiveness and reconcile. We are all new creations of God, but it is up to us to determine how well we want our relationship with Him to be. As Orthodox Christians we all carry a cross and it is not about how long we can carry that cross but rather when we fall, do we pick up our cross and continue the journey. The road is long and narrow but God’s mercy is endless. God has given us all the pieces but it us up to us to put it together and implement it in our daily lives.
#### Questions for Reflection:
1. Have you truly reconciled yourself with God? 
2. Reflect on ways that you can improve how you deal with struggles in your daily life and how you can implement your faith in those moments.

## You Are Your Brother's Keeper
### Published on Aug 04 2014
1 Corinthians 8:1-6
In our Christian life we are given great freedom, yet there are situations that may arise with our fellow brothers and sisters in Christ where we will need to rethink that freedom.1 Corinthians 8 states instructions on Christian freedom, specifically on food sacrificed to Idols.
The chapter begins with Paul telling us that “we know that we all possess knowledge but that knowledge puffs up, and that love builds up (verse 1)”. What exactly does this mean? The bottom line is that love is more significant than knowledge. We can only obtain God’s knowledge by loving Him. Knowledge apart from love makes one prideful. James 3: 17 says, “But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.”
Love is thought of as a feeling or an emotion but in reality, love is a choice and an action. God is the source of our love. He loved us enough to send His own Son to die on the Cross for us, mere sinners. Jesus is that example we ought to follow because everything He did in life and death was out of unconditional love.
1 John 4: 8 reads, "Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.” Notice John specifically says here that “God is love” not “Love is God.” This world that we temporary live in has taken the word love and misinterpreted it to mean that love is just about feeling good and that throwing away any principles or morals that one has in order to obtain such “love” is okay but it is not by any means. Real Love is like God, who is holy, unbiased and flawless. If we truly know God, we will love as He does.
Paul had the liberty to eat meat offered to idols because he knew that there was only one true God and that idols were nothing. In Paul’s mind, eating meat offered to the idols was neither right nor wrong but not all believers felt that way. There were people that believed that the meat was defiled by the idols and therefore it should not be eaten. Paul knew he had to be careful, because his actions could influence those people to eat the meat, violating their conscience and causing them to stumble in their faith. Paul had genuine concern over these believers which kept him from exercising his freedom in its entirety.
Paul is saying that we are not only responsible for ourselves but for one another. Remember when Cain asked in Genesis 4:9 “Am I my brother’s keeper?” well here, Paul is insisting that you are your brother’s keeper!
In Corinth at the time, one of the debated issues was “should the meat offered to the idols be eaten.” For Paul, it was important how the Church was responding to this topic as a family. He knew that there were Corinthians that were arrogant but Paul rebuked the pride and insisted on love conquering.
A theologian once said “If we do not show love to one another, the world has a right to question whether Christianity is true.” Always strive to be humble and love one another, it is our Christian duty. Christian Freedom is tied to and inseparable from Christian responsibility. Some actions may seem perfectly all right for us to do, but may harm a Christian brother or sister that is weak or young in the faith. As they learn more about the Christian life, it is important that we take that into consideration and not do anything that would cause them to stumble or question the path they have decided to take.
Christian life is not about what you know, how strong you are or how much freedom you have. Your Christian life is really summed up by how much you love. You are your brother’s keeper.

## High Priest
### Published on Aug 11 2014
Hebrews 4:14-5:6
This passage taken from St. Paul’s letter to the Hebrews talks about Jesus as the “High Priest”. Through the entire book of Hebrews, St. Paul is urging the Hebrews to maintain their faith in Jesus as Christ and God. He is writing to a group of Christians who are having doubts in their faith in Christ and are returning back to Judaism, and Paul is reminding them what Christ offers is far greater.
In this passage specifically, is explaining the importance and significance of Christ as the “High Priest”. St. Paul says that because Christ has “ascended into heaven”(v.14), referring to His ascension, He has divine authority.  At the same time, however, Paul reminds us that Christ is not a High Priest who judges with apathy, but can empathize with us humans because He was human, and went through the same trials and temptations as we did. Christ, through his incarnation, became man, and was able to live among men on Earth, and presented with all the worldly temptation, remained sinless. Because of this, Jesus Christ as the High Priest does not sit on a throne of judgment, but on a throne of grace, from which he bestows to us His mercy when we come to Him.
The second part of this passage talks about the earthly high priests, or the clergy of the Church. As Christ had become man and was able to empathize with man, so also our clergy must act accordingly. As the passage states, all of our clergy are chosen “from among the people”(v. 1), and this is a fact that is forgotten. Many times we place our clergy on a pedestal, viewing them as holy and spiritual men who are without blemish. It is important that we remember that they are also human and face temptations like we do, and are not without sin. Our clergy consist of ordinary men who have heeded the calling by God. He was chosen from among the people to “represent the people in matters related to God,” (v.1) and on behalf of the sins of the people, including his own, he offers the sacrifice to God. Because of this, because he too is “subject to weakness,” (v.2) he must deal with the people mercifully and gently without judging.
Though this passage refers to the office of the high priest, and we typically associate that with our clergy, we must remember that we are all part of the Holy Priesthood. In the first general epistle of St. Peter, St. Peter reminds us that we are all part of a “chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation.” (1 Peter 2:9) This is because we all partake in the sacraments of Baptism and Chrismation, which are the first qualification or step for the Holy Priesthood. This means, as members of the Holy Priesthood, we should practice the tenets which Christ as the High Priest embodies: we should be compassionate to others, forgiving, show mercy, and empathize with others, as we all have our own struggles in life.
#### Reflection question:
1) Do my every day actions and behavior reflect the principles and attitude that Jesus Christ as the High Priest embodies?
