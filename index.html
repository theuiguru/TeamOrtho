    <h1>What is MGOCSM?</h1>
    <p>In the early parts of the 20th century, students and senior leaders of the Church felt an urge to further their spiritual life and create a lively fellowship for all the Christian students in the various colleges and high schools.</p><p>In 1907, the Syrian Student Conference was formed. On January 1, 1907, the Syrian Student Conference had its first conference at Balikamadom School, Tiruvalla, Kerala. For years after that, the Syrian Student Conference continued to offer the conference annual as a regular feature for years after that. In 1960, the Syrian Student Conference changed its name to Mar Gregorios Orthodox Christian Student Movement and adopted the motto “Worship-Study-Service.”</p><p>Since then, the movement continued to grow to become the oldest Christian Student Organization in India and has expanded to many different nations around the world. MGOCSM maintains interdisciplinary contacts in the academic field for a long time by the formation of its various wings. They are the College student’s wing, High school student’s wing, University teachers Association, Medical Auxiliary Technical Auxiliary, Missionary forum, Literary forum, Publication wing, etc.</p>

<p>Because of the growth, at the 13th annual North American Leadership Camp held at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, both Metropolitans decided the MGOCSM administration would take place on a Diocesan level. However, joint efforts such as Leadership Camp and Missions would continue.</p>

<h1>Service: Missions</h1>
<p>Every year since 2005 the MGOCSM of North America has sent youth from all across America on missions trips throughout India and the United States.  The purpose of these trips is to open the eyes of the participants to the mission work that the Church is conducting in India and to see the need for missions in our community here in America.  It is impossible to change the lives of the orphans, the elderly, the homeless, and the impoverished people that the participants interact with over the short span of one or two-week long trips, but it is the lives of the participants that are truly intended to be changed.  Every person who has gone on a missions trip has testified to noticing a change in their lives, in their ways of thinking.  From one trip a year in the summer, the MGOCSM Missions has grown to conduct two annual trips each year; and this year, we’ve expanded to a total of three trips. The first trip will be held in Mexico during Spring break of 2014, the second trip will be held in India during the summer of 2014, and the last trip will also be held in India during the winter of 2014. The enthusiasm and drive of the MGOCSM youth continue to grow for missions and it is expected that more and more youth will continue to participate in the missions work of the Church. If you or anyone you know are interested, please send an email to mgocsmamericamissions@gmail.com with your name, age, parish, contact information, and which trip you are interested in. A committee member will get back to you promptly.</p>
<h1>Campus Ministry</h1><p>ABOUT CAMPUS MINISTRY IN NORTH AMERICA<br/>The MGOCSM of North America continues to be a vibrant and dynamic youth movement that seeks to build faithful leaders and members of the Holy Church. However, this is often challenged by many college and university campuses that have today become secular environments opposing Christian values. This tendency has negatively affected many of our youth, and they have become victims of fear, peer pressure, stress, and much more. While efforts have been made in some areas to organize regular campus visits and meetings, the reality is there are a number of youth we have been unable to connect with simply because we do not know which college or university they attend and have no contact information for them.</p>
<p>In response to this concern, the MGOCSM of North America is seeking to organize a national directory of all our college students from every parish in both the Northeast and South-West Diocese. In order to fulfill this task, we request all parish MGOCSM units to collect the information of every student in their parish currently pursuing undergraduate, graduate, or post-graduate studies. A copy of the form that details the required information is attached and is also available online at www.mgocsmamerica.com/campusministry. The collected information should be typed into the excel document that is provided and submitted by e-mail to ( mgocsmcampusministry@gmail.com) no later than November 4th, 2012 (deadline extended). In order to coordinate this effort, we hereby appoint MGOCSM Council members, Mr. Manoj Varghese (Washington, D.C.) and Ms. Pushpa Zachariah (California) to work alongside the MGOCSM General Secretary of North America.</p>
<p>We hope by collecting this information we can organize a more effective campus ministry geared towards our students who are studying at various college and university campuses across North America. By providing proper direction and resources to our students along with spiritual guidance, counsel, and fellowship, we hope it will enable our students to live and lead the Orthodox way of life in a secular world. It is also our goal to provide a network for our students that will help empower their careers through academic support and career guidance. We seek the whole-hearted cooperation and support of all parishes to make sure the necessary information is collected and sent at the earliest in order to continue with the next phase of this ministry.</p>
<p>VISION:<br/>The vision of MGOCSM North America's Campus Ministry is to motivate and inspire College Campus Students to become active participants in our church who are motivated to worship, study, and serve God, the church and the community at large.</p>
<p>MISSION STATEMENT:<br/>The mission of establish MGOCSM North America's Campus Ministry is:</p>
<p>To provide proper direction for guidance, counsel, career development and fellowship to live and lead the Orthodox way of life in a secular world.</p><p>To build valued, faithful leaders and responsible members of the Holy Church and the Community at large when acclimating into society.</p>
