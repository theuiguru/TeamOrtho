<div class="main"><h1>MGOCSM of North America</h1><header><h2>Service</h2>
<p>Every year since 2005 the MGOCSM of North America has sent youth from all across America on missions trips throughout India and the United States.  The purpose of these trips is to open the eyes of the participants to the mission work that the Church is conducting in India and to see the need for missions in our community here in America.  It is impossible to change the lives of the orphans, the elderly, the homeless, and the impoverished people that the participants interact with over the short span of one or two-week long trips, but it is the lives of the participants that are truly intended to be changed.  Every person who has gone on a missions trip has testified to noticing a change in their lives, in their ways of thinking.  From one trip a year in the summer, the MGOCSM Missions has grown to conduct two annual trips each year; and this year, weâ€™ve expanded to a total of three trips. The first trip will be held in Mexico during Spring break of 2014, the second trip will be held in India during the summer of 2014, and the last trip will also be held in India during the winter of 2014. The enthusiasm and drive of the MGOCSM youth continue to grow for missions and it is expected that more and more youth will continue to participate in the missions work of the Church. If you or anyone you know are interested, please send an email to mgocsmamericamissions@gmail.com with your name, age, parish, contact information, and which trip you are interested in. A committee member will get back to you promptly.</p></header></div>
